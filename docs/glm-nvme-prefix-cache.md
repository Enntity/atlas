# GLM-5.3-Flash: prefix cache spilled to NVMe

Status: opt-in; no behaviour change without the flags below.

- The tier as first built (`integ/nvme`) has run on the pair: an evicted
  25 K-token conversation's turn 2 starts in 1.53–1.86 s instead of
  11.2–11.5 s, with byte-identical answers (§9).
- `opt/nvme-fast` adds a fast I/O path and record keeping behind two more
  flags (`ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST`, `ATLAS_GLM_NVME_KEEP`). Those are unit-tested
  on a Mac and measured on one GB10's NVMe and GPU in isolation (§9); **they
  have not served a request on the pair yet.**

## Goal

Today, when the GPU prefix cache is full, an idle conversation's KV blocks are
deleted, and so are its KDA (SSM) snapshots once the 16 snapshot slots are
full. When the user comes back, the whole conversation is prefilled again,
which takes tens of seconds to minutes at GLM-5.3 context lengths.

With this change, those blocks and snapshots are written to the node-local
NVMe instead of being deleted. A later prefix hit reads them back in before
the prefill starts, which should take well under a second.

## 1. What existed, and what it does for GLM today

### Prefix cache (radix tree), as served

- `--enable-prefix-caching` builds a `RadixTree`
  (`crates/spark-runtime/src/radix_tree*`). There is one node per 16-token
  block, and each node's `context_hash` is chained from its parent.
- LRU eviction (`radix_tree/inner/evict.rs`) **deletes** the least recently
  used leaf node that no sequence holds, and returns its block to the free
  list. From then on, that prefix is a cache miss.
- The SSM snapshot index (`radix_tree/snapshot*.rs`) is kept separately from
  the tree nodes. With `ATLAS_MARCONI_PREFILL_ONLY=1`, only block-aligned
  prefill checkpoints (about 74 MB each) are saved. On a hit, prefill restores
  the deepest snapshot at or below the matched length and replays forward from
  there (`prefill_b/prefix_lookup.rs`). For a hybrid model like GLM, a KV hit
  with **no** snapshot is recomputed in full: "Prefix cache hit … but no SSM
  snapshot — recomputing all KV".
- Rank agreement (F83): each rank computes its own `matched_tokens`, and the
  ranks agree on the minimum with `ep_min_u32`. The snapshot restore decision
  was **not** synchronised; it was only correct because both ranks' snapshot
  pools happen to evolve identically.

### `--high-speed-swap` (HSS): not usable for this

`crates/spark-storage/src/high_speed_swap*`, `model/block_mgmt.rs`,
`serve_phases/*`:

- HSS offloads a single sequence's **live** KV during **decode**, using a
  sliding window. `--high-speed-swap-cache-blocks-per-seq` (default 64) blocks
  stay resident in GPU memory, older blocks go to per-layer NVMe files, and a
  low-rank predictor chooses which blocks to stream back for tiled attention
  (`ATLAS_HIGH_SPEED_SWAP_REPLACE`, which its own log line marks as "UNTESTED
  on real models").
- Prefill never reads from disk (Issue #31 in `block_mgmt.rs`).
- Its on-disk layout (`GroupLayout`) hard-codes BF16 GQA K/V, striped per KV
  head, sized from `num_key_value_heads`/`head_dim`. GLM's cache is different:
  - a single 512-wide latent head stored as FP8-G128 (528 B per token per
    layer), with V aliasing K;
  - a separate pooled sparse-index cache;
  - sparse MLA decode kernels that do not go through HSS's tiled path.
- Its radix-tree integration (`disk_block_id` refcounts, `matched_disk_block_ids`)
  only keeps disk IDs alive for nodes that are still in the tree. Eviction
  still deletes the node. **HSS never makes an evicted prefix findable again.**
- `kv_paging` / `rdma_kv_backend` are alternative storage backends for HSS
  (a remote RDMA peer), so the same limits apply.

Verdict: none of HSS is reused. The new tier refuses to run alongside it
(`attach_nvme_spill` errors if `cache_blocks_per_seq` is set).

### SSM snapshot spill tier: reused as-is for the KDA snapshots

`ATLAS_SSM_TIER*`, `model/ssm_tier/`, `model/ssm_snapshot_spill.rs`,
`radix_tree/snapshot_tier.rs`:

- When all 16 Marconi slots are in use, the victim snapshot is spilled
  (spill-not-drop) instead of dropped, provided it is at least
  `ATLAS_SSM_SPILL_MIN_TOKENS` deep (default 1024). The index entry stays, so
  a warm lookup finds it and faults it back into a slot (all three prefill
  paths do this, gated by `ATLAS_SSM_FAULT_MIN_TOKENS`, default 256).
- With `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_UNIFIED=1`, the store is a `Residency` with:
  - a host-RAM hot arena of `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SLOTS` × blob, **allocated up
    front, default 64**;
  - LRU spill to an O_DIRECT swap file in `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SWAP_DIR`;
  - a record cap from `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_DISK_GB`.
- For GLM the capability gate passes (the model has recurrent state), and the
  blob is `34 × (h + conv)` per rank. Worked out from
  `test_data/glm5_next_nvidia_nvfp4_config.json`:
  - h = 32 heads × 128 × 128 × 4 B = 2 MiB (FP32, TP2);
  - conv ≈ 3 × 12 288 × 2 B;
  - blob ≈ 73.8 MB by that arithmetic; **the pair logs `blob_bytes=77987840`**
    (78.0 MB) per rank. It is a 4 KiB multiple, and the O_DIRECT arm applies:
    the startup line is `unified SSM tier (marconi-host): O_DIRECT swap file
    in …`. If you see "not a 4 KiB multiple" or "unusable" instead, the swap
    tier is in **host RAM**.
- GB10 gotchas:
  - Host RAM is the same pool as GPU memory, so the default 64-slot hot arena
    costs **about 5 GB**. Set `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SLOTS=2`.
  - The swap file used to be named per PID and **never unlinked** (defect #3
    in `ssm_tier/unified.rs`) — and the PID is 1 in every container, so two
    containers sharing a directory truncated each other's file. It is now
    unlinked once open, and same-tag leftovers are swept at startup.
  - If the swap directory cannot be used, the snapshot tier silently falls
    back to host RAM, bounded only by `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_DISK_GB`. With the KV
    tier on, startup now refuses that configuration instead (§11).
- Gap closed in this change: when a spill tier is enabled, the ranks now agree
  on the Marconi restore (see §5). Before this, a fault-in that succeeded on
  one rank and failed on the other made the ranks diverge on `skip_tokens`,
  which leads to mismatched collectives and a deadlock.

### Related finding, not fixed here

`--swap-space-gb` sequence preemption (`trait_impl/sequence/state_io.rs`)
saves and restores K/V with `read_block`/`write_block` only. **It does not
carry the GLM sparse-index cache** (pooled keys, scales, raw tails — with
slotted tails those also need re-lending), so a GLM sequence restored from a
preemption swap would have stale index keys. A TODO in `state_io.rs` records
this; until fixed, do not combine `--swap-space-gb` with GLM. The fix could
reuse the segment layout in `kv_cache/nvme_spill.rs`.

## 2. What changed

| Layer | File | What |
|---|---|---|

| tree | `radix_tree/inner.rs`, `inner/evict.rs` | `walk` stays resident-only (`block_idx != MAX`, a no-op when the tier is off). `insert` moves an on-disk node onto the recomputed block. `evict` routes to spill mode |
| tree | `radix_tree/nvme.rs`, `prefix_cache/nvme.rs` | `NvmePrefixTier` trait (`PrefixCache::nvme()`), `SpillOrder`/`DiskRef`/`RestorePlan` |

| bytes | `spark-runtime/src/kv_cache/nvme_spill.rs` | Record layout, trailer stamp/verify, attach, dispatch to one of the two I/O paths |
| bytes | `kv_cache/nvme_sync.rs` | The synchronous path (default): staged gather/scatter, one write per record, ranged reads |
| bytes | `kv_cache/nvme_fast.rs`, `kv_cache/nvme_io.rs` | The fast path (`ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST`): pitched copies, run-sized I/O, write-behind and read-ahead over a fixed staging ring and a worker pool (§5) |
| gpu | `spark-runtime/src/gpu.rs`, `cuda_backend/gpu_copy.rs` | `copy_h2d_pitched_async_retained` / `copy_d2h_pitched_async`: one `cudaMemcpy2DAsync` per region per run of blocks |

| model | `spark-model/src/model/prefix_blocks.rs` | `apply_evicted_blocks` writes spills **before** returning blocks; a failed write falls back to plain eviction; spill-mode evict batch of 32 |
| model | `model/kv_nvme.rs` | `restore_prefix` cycle; hybrid restore policy; `agree_marconi_restore` |
| model | `prefill_b/prefix_lookup.rs` | Restore before the chunk-0 lookup; agreement before the Marconi restore |
| build | `factory/build/kv_nvme.rs`, `build.rs` | Env parsing, record file, enable, startup rank-config check, host-memory reserve taken out of the KV budget (§10) |
| moves | `kv_cache/debug_impl.rs`, `prefill_b/prefix_reserve.rs`, `prefix_blocks.rs` | Pure moves that bring touched files toward the 500-LoC cap |

### Invariants

- **An on-disk node has only on-disk descendants.**
  - A spill only picks a resident node with no resident children.
  - A restore promotes an on-disk run from the top down, starting directly
    below the resident prefix.
  - `insert` moves nodes from the top down.
- **Every existing consumer of `PrefixMatch` still sees resident blocks
  only.** A restore happens before `lookup`, and turns on-disk nodes back into
  ordinary resident nodes that hold a single cache reference.
- **Only full blocks are spilled.** A spilled node's `partial_suffix` block is
  released, as happens today.

## 3. Flags

Set identical values on **every rank**. On a multi-rank world, startup
all-gathers a fingerprint of these settings and refuses to start if they
differ. The exchange happens after each rank's own setup (env parse, disk
budget, record file), and a rank whose setup failed sends a sentinel, so one
misconfigured rank stops every rank instead of leaving its peers hung.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ATLAS_KV_NVME_DIR=<dir>` | Enables the KV tier. Must be on the real NVMe filesystem, not tmpfs/overlay (O_DIRECT). |
| `ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB=<GiB>` | **Required** alongside the dir (strict parse, > 0). Per-rank disk budget; the coldest on-disk blocks are dropped beyond it. |
| `ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST=1` | The fast I/O path (§5): same records, moved in run-sized requests and pitched copies, written behind the evicting request. Also reserves the whole budget on disk at startup. Strict `1`/`0`; part of the rank fingerprint. |
| `ATLAS_GLM_NVME_KEEP=1` | A restored block keeps its record, so evicting it again writes nothing (§5). Strict `1`/`0`; part of the rank fingerprint. |

The two `ATLAS_GLM_NVME_*` switches only choose how the tier moves records.
Without `ATLAS_KV_NVME_DIR` they are not read at all: the rank starts exactly
as it does with them unset, whatever they hold, and logs one warning per
switch that is set. (`ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB` without the directory stays an error.)
| `ATLAS_SSM_TIER=1` `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_UNIFIED=1` `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SWAP_DIR=<dir>` `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_DISK_GB=<GiB>` `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SLOTS=2` | Existing KDA snapshot tier (see §1). |

Setting `ATLAS_KV_NVME_DIR` without `--enable-prefix-caching`, or together
with `--high-speed-swap`, is a startup error.

First hardware test (both nodes):

```sh
# CLI, unchanged: --enable-prefix-caching --ssm-cache-slots=16
export ATLAS_MARCONI_PREFILL_ONLY=1
export ATLAS_KV_NVME_DIR=/<nvme-mount>/atlas-kv
export ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB=200
export ATLAS_SSM_TIER=1
export ATLAS_SSM_TIER_UNIFIED=1
export ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SWAP_DIR=/<nvme-mount>/atlas-ssm
export ATLAS_SSM_TIER_DISK_GB=200
export ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SLOTS=2
export ATLAS_SSM_TIER_TIMING=1      # optional: per-spill timing lines
```

## 4. Disk layout

- **One record file per rank:** `<dir>/atlas-kv-prefix.<pid>.r<rank>.swap`,
  opened O_DIRECT and **unlinked immediately**.
  - Its space is returned when the process exits for any reason, including a
    crash.
  - No other process can ever read a stale record.
  - `ls` does not show it; use `df` or `lsof` instead.
- **Record `slot` is at offset `slot × record_bytes`**, and the file grows
  sparsely.
- **Record contents** (this rank's bytes for one 16-token block):
  1. For each attention layer:
     - `K` (the full per-block stride; for FP8-G128 that includes the scales);
     - `V`, only when it does not alias K (GLM: aliased, so omitted);
     - pooled index values, plus pooled index scales when present.
  2. Zero padding.
  3. A 24-byte trailer: `magic "ATLKVNV1" | tag | checksum`.
- **Raw index tails are not stored.** They only hold the un-pooled keys and
  gates of a pool that is still being filled. `glm_index_kpool_finalize`
  pools each 4-token group when its last token is written, and only full
  blocks (all 4 pools finalised) are spilled.
  - Slotted tails (prefix caching + `ATLAS_MARCONI_PREFILL_ONLY`) change
    nothing in the record. A spilled block's lent tail returns with its last
    KV ref (`return_evicted_block`), and a restored block is published
    tail-less before the prefill reads it.
  - If the index moves to scaled FP8, the scales segment is picked up
    automatically.
- **GLM-5.3 sizes per rank:**
  - payload: 11 layers × (8448 + 1024) = 104 192 B;
  - record: **106 496 B per block** (26 × 4 KiB), which is **6.66 KB per
    token**;
  - 200 GiB ≈ 2.0 M blocks ≈ 32 M tokens.
- **Tag:** a hash of the node's causal `context_hash` and a spill epoch, held
  by the tree.
- **Checksum:** a 4-lane, 64-bit multiply-fold over the payload.
- **Host RAM:** one tree node per on-disk block — about **640 B** each, not
  the 150–250 B first estimated (§10 has the breakdown) — so a disk budget is
  also a host-memory budget: 24 GiB of records ≈ 148 MiB, 200 GiB ≈ 1.2 GiB.
  Plus the pinned staging: 3.4 MB (synchronous path) or 13.6 MB (fast path).

## 5. Spill, restore, and rank agreement

### Spill (at eviction)

1. `alloc_block_evicting` asks the tree for 32 blocks. With the tier off it
   asks for 1, as before.
2. The tree converts the LRU victims to on-disk nodes and returns
   `SpillOrder`s.
3. `apply_evicted_blocks` then:
   1. syncs the whole device (`cuCtxSynchronize`) — a victim's last writes
      can still be in flight on the prefill stream or another non-blocking
      stream;
   2. queues 22 async D2H copies per block into pinned staging;
   3. syncs once;
   4. stamps the trailers and `pwrite`s each record;
   5. **only then** returns the blocks to the free list.

A failed write triggers `spill_failed`, which drops that node, so the block
is evicted as it would be without the tier. Warnings are throttled (1, 2, 4,
8, …).

**Fast path (`ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST=1`).** Steps 1–2 are unchanged; step 3
becomes:

1. sync the whole device (as above);
2. sort the batch by block and gather each run of consecutive blocks with
   **one pitched copy per region** (22 copies for a 32-block run, not 704)
   into chunks of a pinned staging ring (8 chunks × 16 records);
3. sync once, hand the chunks to the worker pool, and **return the blocks to
   the free list**. Their bytes now belong to a queued write: the chunk is
   not reused until its write has finished.

A worker pads and checksums the chunk's records and writes each run of
consecutive slots with one request (`pwritev` when the run is back to front —
a chain spilled leaf first has ascending slots and descending blocks). A run
of ONE block (a fragmented pool) is moved with the synchronous path's plain
copies, one per region: a one-row pitched copy costs the same (36 µs per
block gathered, 73 µs scattered, either way — §9), so fragmentation degrades
the GPU side to the synchronous path's cost and no further.

The evicting thread waits when all 8 chunks are in flight. In a burst — a
25 K-token prefill or restore evicting 1,582 blocks — the ring fills after the
first 128, and from there the spill is throttled to the disk's write speed.
That wait is timed separately (`spill_wait_micros`) and logged. If the ring
ever has neither a free chunk nor a write to wait for (a leaked chunk; not
reachable today), the batch fails like a gather failure — those blocks are
evicted as without the tier — instead of spinning on the serving thread.

What keeps this safe:

- a restore drains every queued write before it reads;
- a spill that re-uses a slot whose earlier write is still queued drains
  first, so the later record is the one on disk;
- within one batch the last order per slot wins (the budget can re-issue a
  slot inside a batch; the earlier node is already gone);
- a write that fails is reported on the next spill or restore. Until then
  its node points at a record with the wrong tag, which fails verification —
  a recompute, never stale bytes;
- a failed RUN is reported as a whole, although its leading records may be
  on disk intact. A report for a node that is resident again is ignored: with
  kept records that node was restored from the very record in question,
  which therefore verified.

**Kept records (`ATLAS_GLM_NVME_KEEP=1`).** A restored block normally gives
its slot back. With this flag it keeps it: the node is resident AND has a
record. Cached full blocks are never rewritten, so that record stays valid
for as long as the node lives, and evicting the block again is pure
bookkeeping — no gather, no write (`clean_evictions` in the stats). Kept
records count against the budget, so they are only kept while at most half of
it is in use; an `insert` that recomputes a block still releases its slot.

### Restore (prefill_b, chunk 0, before `lookup`)

1. `plan_restore` walks the prompt's verified full blocks, finds the on-disk
   run below the resident prefix, and **pins** the whole path (one extra
   radix ref), so evictions caused by the restore cannot take it.
2. It decides how many blocks to restore:
   - pure attention: all of them;
   - hybrid (GLM): up to the deepest usable Marconi anchor, resident or
     spill-tiered (`snapshot_anchor_depth`, read-only), and nothing if there
     is no anchor at least `marconi_min_tokens` deep. Without an anchor the
     KV would be recomputed anyway, and KV past the anchor is replayed through
     every layer regardless.
3. It allocates blocks (possibly spilling other conversations), then reads
   runs of consecutive slots with one `pread` each. A chain spilled leaf-first
   gets consecutive slots in descending order, and the reader handles either
   direction. It verifies every trailer, then scatters with `copy_h2d_async_retained`
   and one stream sync per 32 records.
   - **Fast path:** the target blocks are sorted first, so the restored chain
     sits on ascending blocks. Up to 8 chunks are read ahead by the workers
     (one request per slot run, checksums verified there), while the serving
     thread scatters each finished chunk with one pitched copy per region per
     run of consecutive blocks. The first record that fails stops the
     restore; read-ahead past it is discarded.
4. `complete_restore` promotes the verified prefix, drops the subtree of a
   record that failed, and unpins. Blocks that were not adopted are freed.
5. The ordinary `lookup` then matches the restored blocks. From here on the
   existing flow applies: F83 min-agreement, then Marconi lookup/fault-in and
   replay.

### Latency (per rank; both ranks run in parallel on their own NVMe)

The first estimates in this section were wrong by an order of magnitude —
they assumed 2–3 µs per small copy and 80–100 µs per synchronous write. §9
has what was measured and why. In short, per block, on the synchronous path:
about 220–250 µs for the record's own `pwrite`, 26 µs per checksum, and
22 small copies at several microseconds each in both directions.

| Context | Blocks | Bytes/rank | Synchronous path, pool full (25 K: pair run; larger: scaled at its 340–520 µs/block) | Fast path, read + scatter (projected) | Fast path, plus evicting as many unwritten victims (projected) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 25 K | 1 582 | 168 MB | 0.53–0.82 s | ~0.03–0.08 s | ~0.05–0.13 s |
| 128 K | 8 000 | 852 MB | ~2.7–4.2 s | ~0.15–0.4 s | ~0.25–0.65 s |
| 512 K | 32 000 | 3.4 GB | ~11–17 s | ~0.6–1.6 s | ~1.0–2.6 s |

The fast-path columns are projections from §9 (the disk pipeline at
10–48 µs/block across runs of the microbench, GPU scatter at 8–25 µs/block
in the isolated probes, the two overlapped; the low end needs a quiet
host, and both assume consecutive blocks and slots — the restore line's
blocks-per-run figures say how true that was). The log line reports the
parts (`evict … ms + read … ms (… MB/s)`, the writer waits inside `evict`,
and the flush before the read), which is what the pair run has to confirm.
With `ATLAS_GLM_NVME_KEEP=1`, victims that were themselves restored cost
nothing, and the last column collapses toward the one before it.

Add to either path the KDA snapshot fault-in (one 78 MB blob) and the replay
from the anchor, which are existing behaviour: on the pair they are the
remaining ~1.0 s of the 1.53–1.86 s turn-2 start.

**Spill cost on the evicting request.** Synchronous path: 250–300 µs per
evicted block on the serving thread in the pipeline microbench, before any
GPU copy cost — 0.4–0.5 s of an 11 s, 25 K-token prefill, which is
consistent with the turn-1 TTFT rise of up to 5% seen on the pair. Fast
path, projected: the gather (one device sync and 22 pitched copies per
32-block batch, about 10–30 µs per block in the isolated probes) plus, once
the 8-chunk ring is full, the wait for the writer — up to about 41 µs per
block at the 2.6 GB/s measured for 8 concurrent single-record writers, less
for run-sized writes. That is 0.02–0.11 s for the same prefill.

### Rank-agreement guarantees

- **KV:** each rank restores on its own, and the existing F83 `ep_min_u32` on
  `matched_tokens` then caps every rank to the shortest match.
  - A rank that restored more keeps the extra blocks as ordinary cache
    entries. They are released and re-looked-up, exactly as in F83 today.
  - A restore issues no collectives, so its partial failure on one rank cannot
    deadlock.
- **Marconi:** when any spill tier is enabled on a multi-rank world, every
  rank calls `agree_marconi_restore` exactly once per chunk-0 lookup, with
  depth 0 if it has no eligible anchor. This is two `ep_min_u32` rounds (min
  of the value and min of its complement). A restore happens **only if every
  rank is eligible at the same depth**. Otherwise all ranks take the
  no-restore path together: a recompute, never a divergence.
  - With both tiers off this is a no-op, so there are no new collectives on
    the default path.
- **Configuration:** at startup, every multi-rank world all-gathers
  `(KV slots, record size, ATLAS_SSM_TIER set)` (or a failure sentinel) and
  aborts on a mismatch or a failed rank, because the flags gate paired
  collectives. This single 8-byte all-gather at startup is the one addition
  to the default path.

## 6. Failure handling (never serve stale data)

| Event | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Disk full / `pwrite` error at spill | The node is dropped and the block evicted as without the tier. Throttled warning. Later hits on that prefix recompute. On the fast path the drop happens at the next spill or restore; the record fails verification in between. |
| Disk cannot hold the budget (fast path) | Startup error naming `ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB`: the whole budget is reserved (`fallocate`) before serving, so a spill cannot run out of disk later. Every rank stops. |
| Directory on tmpfs / ramfs / overlayfs, or not writable | Startup error naming the variable (KV directory, and the snapshot tier's swap directory when it is configured). Every rank stops. |
| A worker thread panics (fast path) | Caught; the job is reported as failed (a write: those nodes are dropped; a read: the restore stops there). The serving thread never waits on a job that cannot finish. |
| Staging ring with no free chunk and no write in flight (fast path; a leak) | The spill batch fails (plain eviction) with a warning; a restore attempts nothing and the prefix recomputes. No wait. |
| A write failure reported after its node was restored (kept records) | Ignored for that node: it was restored from that record, which verified. The failure is still counted. |
| Budget full | The coldest droppable on-disk leaf is dropped (LRU). If the eviction candidate is colder than every on-disk block, the candidate itself is deleted instead. |
| `pread` error / short read at restore | The verified prefix is kept. The failing record's node and its on-disk subtree are dropped. The rest is recomputed. |
| Wrong tag, bad magic, or checksum mismatch | Treated the same as a read error. The bytes are never scattered into a block the tree adopts. |
| No free blocks to restore into | Partial restore. The remainder is recomputed. |
| KDA snapshot fault-in miss or error | Existing behaviour (reap on miss, retain on error), and with rank agreement it is always a symmetric recompute. |
| Process crash | The record file is already unlinked, so its space is reclaimed. No state survives a restart; the cache starts empty. |

## 7. Not done / unverified

- **The fast path and kept records have not served a request.** Verified so
  far: unit tests on both I/O paths (byte-identical records either way), the
  Linux `O_DIRECT` / `preadv` / `pwritev` / `fallocate` arms and the real
  pipeline on a GB10's NVMe, and the copy shapes on a GB10 GPU in isolation —
  including that `cudaMemcpy2DAsync` with the record as host pitch is
  byte-exact in both directions for runs of 1 to 511 blocks (§9).
  Not verified: those copies between the pinned ring and the KV pools inside
  the server, the ring under a real eviction burst, a fragmented pool (the
  A/B below runs on a fresh server, where blocks and slots are consecutive),
  and every end-to-end number.
- **Restore only runs in `prefill_b`** (chunked prefill), the multi-rank path.
  `prefill_a`/`prefill_c` and the single-rank batched reservation path stay
  resident-only: correct, just no restore.
- **Assumptions to watch on hardware:**
  - all ranks build through `build_model` (as `agree_kv_blocks` already
    requires);
  - GLM sets `uses_local_mla_prefill() == false`, so the prefix skip is taken;
  - tails of full blocks are never read;
  - `cuMemAllocHost` staging is page-aligned (a warning at attach says so if
    it is not; I/O then bounces — correct, slower).
- **Worth doing next:**
  - the tree's per-block footprint (§10): ~640 B per on-disk block makes host
    RAM, not disk, the limit on the budget. An on-disk node needs neither its
    own `children` table nor a second copy of its key;
  - the ~230 µs every blocking request costs on this machine (§9): with
    requests this large it no longer limits a contiguous restore, but a
    fragmented one is bound by it. A PM-QoS latency request held for the
    duration of a restore, or an io_uring ring polled from the waiting
    thread, would remove it;
  - spilling ahead of demand when the server is idle, so a restore finds
    free blocks instead of evicting;
  - the decode ring's swap file (`atlas-decode-ring.<pid>.swap`) still leaks
    (the other half of unified.rs defect #3; GLM does not use it).
- **Not persisted across restarts, by design.**

## 8. Hardware validation plan

1. **Baseline, cache off:** N = 24 conversations with fixed seeds (distinct
   system prompts; 8–64 K tokens each, total well past GPU KV capacity; see
   the capacity line `KV cache: … blocks`). Run 2 turns each, temperature 0,
   and record each turn-2 answer and TTFT.
2. **Cache on, tiers off (control):** the same run. Revisiting a conversation
   after the others have filled the cache should log `cached_tokens=0` or no
   snapshot, and TTFT should look like a full prefill.
3. **Cache on, flags from §3:**
   - Fill: run turn 1 of all N conversations sequentially. Expect the
     `prefix cache NVMe spill tier ON` line at startup and `SSM tier disk tier
     ENGAGED` once the snapshot hot arena is full. The KV tier's spill count
     shows up in the stats on each restore line.
   - Revisit: run turn 2 of each conversation, oldest first. Expect, per
     request on **both** ranks:
     - `NVMe prefix restore: k/k blocks … in X ms`, with X under 1 s at 128 K;
     - `SSM tier fault-in: restored spilled snapshot at token D`;
     - a Marconi intermediate hit that replays only a few dozen tokens;
     - usage `cached_tokens > 0`;
     - **TTFT ≈ restore time + replay**, not a full prefill;
     - no `spill-tier rank agreement: … differs` lines.
   - Correctness: every turn-2 answer is **byte-identical** to the cache-off
     baseline at temperature 0. Also run the golden BFCL leg with the flags on
     and compare against the flags-off score.
4. **Failure drills:**
   - Tiny budget (`ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB=1`): expect disk drops, and still correct
     answers.
   - Unwritable dir: expect a startup error.
   - Env on one rank only: expect a startup abort naming the mismatch.
   - Fill the filesystem mid-run: expect throttled spill warnings, answers
     still correct, and no hang.
5. **Soak:** 2 h of mixed agentic traffic, checking that no free-block leak
   appears (`num_free_blocks` returns to baseline when idle), that RSS is
   bounded, and that there are no deadlocks.
6. **Fast path A/B** (one server start per arm, pool capped with
   `ATLAS_KV_MAX_BLOCKS=7500` so 8 conversations of 25 K tokens evict each
   other):
   - `sync`: the flags from §3;
   - `fast`: plus `ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST=1`;
   - `fastkeep`: plus `ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST=1 ATLAS_GLM_NVME_KEEP=1`.

   Each arm runs the same 23 salted requests (about 2.5 minutes): 8 cold
   conversations, turn 2 of each (first restore), turn 3 of conversations
   0–3 (second restore — with `fastkeep`, from records that survived a
   restore and a write-free eviction), and turn 3 of conversations 4 and 5
   sent together. Answers are planted text (three codes and ten ledger
   entries per conversation), checked exactly.

   The restore line, on both ranks (one line in the log; the numbers are an
   illustration, not a measurement):

   ```text
   NVMe prefix restore: 1582/1582 blocks (25312 tokens after 0 resident) in 96.4 ms;
     tier 5204/403298 slots, 17871 spills, 12659 restores, 0 failures;
     evict 52.0 ms + read 33.3 ms (5059 MB/s);
     spill path (fast): 17871 blocks in 702.7 ms on the serving thread,
     0 evictions without a write;
     this restore: writer wait 31.0 ms in evict, flush 9.8 ms before read,
     31.6 blocks/scatter run, 1582 spilled at 30.4 blocks/gather run;
     spill path waited 310.2 ms for the writer
   ```

   - `in X ms` is the whole restore;
   - `evict` is allocating the target blocks, which on a full pool is
     spilling that many victims: the gather plus `writer wait`;
   - `flush` is the wait for those victims' queued writes before the first
     read;
   - `read` is read + verify + scatter only, and carries the MB/s;
   - `blocks/… run` is how contiguous the blocks were (1.0 = one copy per
     region per block, the synchronous path's cost);
   - `spill path` is the cumulative time `nvme_write` has cost the serving
     thread since startup, and `spill path waited` the part of it spent
     waiting for the writer.

   GO needs, against the `sync` arm and on **both** ranks: every answer
   exact; every warm request matching its whole turn-1 prompt
   (`cached_tokens`) and starting within 0.3× its own cold TTFT; exactly one
   complete restore per warm request, no failure, no F83 cap, no `no SSM
   snapshot`, no rank disagreement; restore time ≤ 95 µs per block and at
   most a third of `sync`'s; read + verify + scatter ≥ 1.5 GB/s and at least
   twice `sync`'s; gather
   ≤ 80 µs per evicted block and the whole serving-thread spill cost at most
   a third of `sync`'s; the evicting turn-1 prefills no slower than `sync`'s;
   turn-2 TTFT at least 0.25 s lower. With `fastkeep`, additionally at least
   1,000 `evictions without a write` before the second restores.

## 9. Where the time went

**How far each statement below goes.** Three kinds of evidence, not to be
mixed up:

- *Pair run* (2026-09-29, `integ/nvme` b5ce84c1, synchronous path, TP2 on
  ennspark01/02, pool capped with `ATLAS_KV_MAX_BLOCKS=7500`,
  `ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB=40`, 8 conversations of ~25 K tokens, 2 turns,
  temperature 0, thinking off; one run): the end-to-end numbers.
- *Isolated probes* on one other GB10 (ennspark03, Samsung MZALC4T0HBL1,
  ext4, kernel 7.0.0-1019; small C / CUDA programs, mostly single-shot; the
  host was serving other models throughout and its GPU read 96% utilisation,
  so the GPU figures are ratios within one probe, not absolutes).
- *Pipeline microbench* (`nvme_disk_bench`, release build in the CI sandbox
  container on ennspark03 with 10 CPUs; six runs — three at 680bb633 and
  three of the same pipeline just before it — ranges shown; the host's other
  load moves a run by 2–4×, which is why they are ranges): the real
  spill/restore code on a real `O_DIRECT` file with the mock GPU.

Nothing here is an end-to-end measurement of the fast path. Every fast-path
figure for the pair is a projection until the A/B of §8 has run.

The pair measurement: 1,582 blocks (25,312 tokens, 168 MB per rank) restored
in 534–824 ms, about 300 MB/s. The spill counter in the same log lines
advances by 1,567–1,598 between restores: the pool was full, so **every
restore also spilled about as many victims as it restored, synchronously,
inside its own allocation loop**. The 534–824 ms is both directions.

Isolated probes:

**Disk, `O_DIRECT`, one thread.** A blocking request costs ~210–250 µs
whatever its size, up to about 1 MB:

| Request | Read | Write (overwrite) |
|---|---|---|
| 4 KiB | 235 µs | 278 µs |
| 104 KiB (one record) | 212 µs — 0.50 GB/s | 256 µs — 0.42 GB/s |
| 1 MiB | 234 µs — 4.5 GB/s | 174 µs — 6.0 GB/s |
| 3.4 MB (32 records) | 565 µs — 6.0 GB/s | 542 µs — 6.3 GB/s |

A 4 KiB read taking as long as a 1 MiB one says the fixed cost is not data
transfer. It equals the exit latency the kernel reports for the CPU idle
state `LPI-2` (231 µs), which is a candidate cause, not a demonstrated one.
Either way the consequence is the same: **one request per record caps a
thread at about 0.45 GB/s; the levers are bigger requests and more of them
in flight.**

**Disk, concurrent writers** (8 threads, one record per request): 0.36 GB/s
into a growing file, 2.6 GB/s into reserved (`fallocate`) extents, 2.9 GB/s
into written ones. ext4 takes the inode lock exclusively for a direct write
that has to allocate, so writers into a growing file queue up. Hence the
up-front reservation on the fast path.

**Checksum:** 26 µs per record on one core (4.1 GB/s) — a quarter of a
2 GB/s budget if it stays on the serving thread, in each direction.

**GPU copies** (11 layers × 2 regions = 22 regions per block):

| Shape | Host → device | Device → host |
|---|---|---|
| 22 `cuMemcpyAsync` per block (synchronous path) | 160 µs/block — 0.67 GB/s | 118 µs/block — 0.91 GB/s |
| 22 pitched copies per run of 8–512 blocks | 8–25 µs/block — 4–13 GB/s | 10–31 µs/block — 3.4–11 GB/s |

One batch of 704 small copies takes 1.0 ms to enqueue and 5.0 ms to drain:
about 7 µs of copy-engine time per copy, regardless of its 1–8 KiB size.
Alternatives measured and dropped: one large copy into a device scratch
followed by device-side pitched copies (63 µs/block) and a scatter kernel
reading the pinned ring through its device alias (77 µs/block). A
region-major record layout would reach 3–8 µs/block (20–40 GB/s) but changes
the record format for no end-to-end gain at these sizes.

**Adding it up for the synchronous path,** per block restored with one victim
spilled: 222–256 µs (`pwrite`) + 2 × 26 µs (checksums) + 16 µs (`pread` in
32-record runs) + the small copies in both directions. Disk and checksums
alone are ~290–325 µs, i.e. 460–515 ms for 1,582 + 1,582 blocks — and the
pipeline microbench below, which has no GPU in it, lands at 484–535 ms for
that scenario on a different node. That is consistent with the pair's
534–824 ms being mostly one `pwrite` per record; it has not been confirmed
by timing the phases on the pair itself (the new log line does that).

The turn-1 TTFT regression fits the same arithmetic: a 25 K-token prefill on
a full pool evicts ~1,582 blocks at 250–350 µs each on the serving thread,
0.4–0.55 s of an ~11 s prefill, against the observed rise of up to 5%.

**Pipeline microbench, both paths** (4 conversations of 1,582 blocks; the
raw output of each run is kept beside the probe sources):

| Case | Synchronous path | Fast path |
|---|---|---|
| Spill, fresh tier: serving-thread time per block | 253–301 µs (0.35–0.42 GB/s) | 9–23 µs (4.7–12 GB/s) |
| Restore one conversation, contiguous slots | 54–103 ms (1.6–3.1 GB/s) | 16–76 ms (2.2–10.3 GB/s) |
| Restore + evict 1,582 victims (the pair scenario) | 478–594 ms | 35–92 ms |
| Spill, recycled slots in scattered order, per block | 250–344 µs | 35–44 µs |
| Restore one conversation, scattered slots | 431–687 ms (0.25–0.39 GB/s) | 77–90 ms (1.9–2.2 GB/s) |

Run it on an NVMe-backed checkout with
`cargo test --release -p spark-runtime --lib nvme_disk_bench -- --ignored --nocapture`.
It does not measure the GPU copies, and the mock's host `memcpy` stands in
for them on both paths. On the pair, the restore line is the judge.

**Pitched copies on the GPU** (isolated probe on the same GB10, record layout
of GLM-5.3, three runs):

- *Byte-exact.* Runs of 1, 2, 3, 16, 31, 32, 128 and 511 consecutive blocks
  were gathered with one pitched copy per region into record-pitched staging,
  scattered to other blocks the same way and read back with plain copies:
  154 MB compared per run of the probe, 0 bytes wrong, the record padding and
  the neighbouring blocks untouched.
- *A run of one block.* 512 scattered blocks, 22 copies each: 36 µs per
  block gathered and 73 µs scattered, the same whether each copy is a
  one-row pitched copy or a plain async copy (best of 7 identical to 0.1 ms
  in all three runs). The fast path uses the plain copy there. A fully
  fragmented pool therefore costs the fast path what it costs the
  synchronous one on the GPU side — about 110 µs per block restored and
  evicted — and the blocks-per-run figures in the restore line say how far
  from that a given restore was.

## 10. Memory the tier takes (per rank)

GB10 memory is one pool: host RAM, pinned host memory and device memory all
come out of the same 121.7 GiB, and the hosts run with about 2 GB free. The
tier allocates **nothing on the device**. On the host, for GLM-5.3 with the
flags of §11:

| Allocation | Kind | Size | Committed | Accounted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| KV staging | pinned | fast: 8 chunks × 16 records × 106,496 B = **13.6 MB**; synchronous: 32 records = 3.4 MB. Fixed. | at attach, after KV sizing | reserve |
| Tree nodes + slot index of on-disk blocks | heap | **~640 B per on-disk block**: 24 GiB of records → 242 K blocks → **148 MiB**; 40 GiB → 246 MiB; 200 GiB → 1.2 GiB | as blocks spill | reserve, at a full budget |
| I/O workers (fast path) | 8 thread stacks | a few tens of KiB touched each | at attach | not reserved |
| Snapshot tier hot arena | heap, zeroed `Vec` | `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SLOTS` × 78.0 MB = **156 MB** at 2 slots | page by page, as slots fill | reserve |
| Snapshot spill / fault-in staging | pinned | one blob = **78 MB** | at the first spill | reserve |
| Snapshot residency scratch | heap, zeroed, page-aligned | one blob = 78 MB | at construction, before KV sizing | positional (already in `used_so_far`) |
| Snapshot swap file's bounce buffer | heap | one blob of address space, never touched (callers are page-aligned) | never | — |

Where the 640 B goes, per on-disk block: the `RadixNode` (152 B, in a `Vec`
that doubles — 1.5× on average), its `parent_key` (16 tokens × 4 B plus the
allocator header), its entry in the parent's `children` map (a 4-bucket
table of 32 B buckets, plus the 64 B key), and the slot index (owner, tag,
disk-LRU entry). A unit test pins the constant to the struct size.

**KV sizing.** `build_model` sizes the KV pool from what is free at that
point, so anything committed later is invisible to it. With
`ATLAS_KV_NVME_DIR` set it now reserves the rows marked "reserve" out of the
KV budget (`kv_nvme::host_reserve_bytes`; the startup line is `NVMe spill
tiers: reserving … MiB of host memory out of the KV budget`). At the defaults
of §11 that is 13.6 + 155 + 234 ≈ **400 MB**, about 3,800 of the ~101,000
blocks the pool has at 0.93 utilisation (3.8%). Without the KV tier nothing
changes.

The reserve is a ceiling: it assumes the disk budget fills. The way to give
less of the pool away is a smaller `ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB` (6.0 MiB of host RAM per
GiB of records) or `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SLOTS=1` (78 MB).

## 11. What a SparkGLM install needs

**A directory on each node's NVMe, bind-mounted into that node's rank
container.** For example host `/var/lib/sparkglm/nvme` → container `/nvme`,
mode 0700, owned by the container user. It must be a real disk filesystem
(ext4/xfs): startup refuses tmpfs, ramfs and overlayfs by name, and probes
that it can create an `O_DIRECT` file there. Atlas creates the `kv` and `ssm`
subdirectories itself. The two ranks do not share storage; each node uses
its own disk.

**One server per directory.** Every process opens its record file once,
exclusively and owner-only, and the startup sweep only unlinks names (a live
owner keeps its descriptor), so a second process in the same KV directory
cannot read or clobber another's records. It is still not a supported
layout: each process reserves its own `ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB`, and the snapshot
tier's file name carries the PID only — PID 1 in every container — so two
servers started at the same instant in one `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SWAP_DIR` could
open the same file.

**Profile environment, identical on both ranks** (startup all-gathers a
fingerprint and refuses to start on a mismatch):

```sh
ATLAS_KV_NVME_DIR=/nvme/kv
ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB=24
ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST=1
ATLAS_GLM_NVME_KEEP=1
ATLAS_SSM_TIER=1
ATLAS_SSM_TIER_UNIFIED=1
ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SWAP_DIR=/nvme/ssm
ATLAS_SSM_TIER_DISK_GB=24
ATLAS_SSM_TIER_SLOTS=2
# unchanged: --enable-prefix-caching --ssm-cache-slots=16,
#            ATLAS_MARCONI_PREFILL_ONLY=1, ATLAS_PREFIX_SUBBLOCK=0
```

**Default disk budget: 24 GiB of KV records and 24 GiB of snapshots per
node.**

- 24 GiB of records is 242 K blocks, 3.9 M tokens — 4.8 times the GPU pool's
  ~810 K. It is host RAM, not disk, that sets this: every GiB of records
  costs 6 MiB of index that comes out of the KV pool (§10). 24 GiB costs
  148 MiB; the 200 GiB of the first test would cost 1.2 GiB.
- 24 GiB of snapshots is 330 blobs of 78 MB. A restore needs one anchor at
  or below the restored depth; without it the KV is recomputed anyway.
- The KV file's 24 GiB are **reserved at startup** on the fast path. The
  snapshot file grows on demand up to its cap. The installer should require
  60 GiB free on the mount (both budgets plus margin).

**Stale files.** None to manage. Both files are unlinked as soon as they are
open, so a crash leaves nothing and `ls` shows an empty directory (`df` shows
the space). At startup each tier also removes leftovers carrying its own name
(`atlas-kv-prefix.*.swap`, `atlas-ssm-marconi-host.*.swap`) — a process
killed between create and unlink, or a build from before the unlink. Nothing
is reused across restarts: the cache starts empty.

**Missing or unusable directory.**

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Directory missing | Created. If the mount itself is missing, the path resolves into the container's overlay and startup refuses it by name. |
| Not writable, read-only mount, no `O_DIRECT` | Startup error naming the variable. Every rank stops. |
| tmpfs / ramfs | Startup error: a "disk" tier there would spend the memory it exists to save. |
| Snapshot swap directory unusable | Startup error when the KV tier is on. (On its own, the snapshot tier falls back to host-RAM records bounded only by `ATLAS_SSM_TIER_DISK_GB` — fatal on a GB10.) |
| Disk too small for `ATLAS_KV_NVME_GB` | Startup error from the reservation (fast path). |
| Disk fills later | Cannot happen to the KV file (reserved). A snapshot that cannot be written is dropped; that prefix recomputes. |
| Budget full | The coldest on-disk blocks are dropped; nothing fails. |
| I/O error or corrupt record at restore | That record and everything below it are forgotten; the prefix recomputes from there. |

**What the operator sees.** One startup line per rank (`prefix cache NVMe
spill tier ON (rank r): …, budget 24.0 GiB = 241979 blocks = 3871664 tokens;
fast I/O, restored records kept, 13.0 MiB pinned staging, up to 147.7 MiB
host index`), the reserve line of §10, and one `NVMe prefix restore:` line per
restored request. Warnings are throttled: a failing disk logs at 1, 2, 4, 8, …
failed spills.

**Wear.** Each spilled token writes 6.66 KB per rank. Without
`ATLAS_GLM_NVME_KEEP`, a conversation that is restored and evicted on every
turn is rewritten in full every turn (3.4 GB per turn at 512 K tokens); with
it, a block is written once for as long as its record is kept.
