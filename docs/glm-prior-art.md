# GLM-5.3-Flash (SparkGLM) prior art and third-party material

What the GLM-5.3-Flash work on this fork took from other projects, and
where. `CITATIONS.md` at the repository root belongs to the separate
TurboQuant+ branch and is not about this work.

Three kinds of debt, kept apart:

- **Code or data copied or adapted**: kept only under a license compatible
  with AGPL-3.0-only, with the origin, copyright and license notice in the
  file and below.
- **Ideas or designs taken** from a named project: no license obligation,
  but credited here and in the module that implements them.
- **Related work** we did not derive from: listed so readers can compare.

Commit messages cannot be amended, so these credits live in the code and
in this file.

## Ideas and designs taken

No code from these projects is in this tree.

| Feature (switch) | Where | Prior art | Ours |
|---|---|---|---|
| DFlash verify width from drafter confidence (`ATLAS_DFLASH_CONF_WIDTH`) | `scheduler/dflash_conf_width.rs`, `dflash_head/draft_conf.rs`, `DF2_SEL_CONF` in `kernels/gb10/common/dflash2_candidate_selector.cu` | knapcio's draft-shape truncation `GLM_DRAFT_TRUNC` ([`overlay/glm_draft_trunc.py`](https://github.com/knapcio/GLM-5.3-Flash-4x-DGX-Spark-TP4/blob/982e258/overlay/glm_draft_trunc.py) @ 982e258): log max softmax per draft, a position x confidence-bin acceptance table, expected tokens from survival products, one uniform width maximizing expected tokens less a per-row price | Online decayed calibration pooled over depths, fixed `TAU` price, periodic full-width probe |
| One-shot RDMA exchange (`ATLAS_RDMA_ONESHOT`, `ATLAS_RDMA_PAIR_CHAIN`) | `kernels/gb10/common/rdma_oneshot.cu`, `spark-comm/.../rdma_pair/oneshot.rs`, `atlas-rdma/src/rdma_shim.c` (`rs_post_write_flag`) | b12x RoCEnante ([local-inference-lab/b12x](https://github.com/local-inference-lab/b12x) `b12x/comm/roce/`, `docs/rocenante.md`; RoCEnante by Jason Cook in [#295](https://github.com/local-inference-lab/b12x/pull/295), b12x maintained by Luke Alonso; Apache-2.0): parity slots, a proxy that WRITEs data then a seq flag on the same QP, poison on timeout. The graph-replay wedge hazard is [b12x#313](https://github.com/local-inference-lab/b12x/issues/313), which reached us through [jayleaton/glm53-tensorfold-spark](https://github.com/jayleaton/glm53-tensorfold-spark) `docs/SFXNZ-AUDIT.md`. The kernel's block structure (device-resident seq, block 0 polls host flags and republishes a device go word, last block out stores seq) follows mmastrac's arx one-shot all-reduce ([mmastrac/glm-5.3-flash-4x-gx10](https://github.com/mmastrac/glm-5.3-flash-4x-gx10) `experimental/arx/arx_vllm.cu`, PR #4; that directory has no license, so idea only) | Size-checked flags (`seq << 24 \| bytes`), desync detection, host-side poison, copy-engine staging with the `stage` word handshake. The base pair channel (`rdma_pair`, 2026-09-26) was written before any note of ours mentions RoCEnante |
| PDL weight touch (`ATLAS_GLM_DECODE_GEMV_BATCH`) | `kernels/gb10/glm-5.3-flash/nvfp4/atlas_pdl_touch.cuh`, `layers/ops/gemv_touch.rs` | Same technique as TensorFold's L2 weight touch ([jayleaton/glm53-tensorfold-spark](https://github.com/jayleaton/glm53-tensorfold-spark) patches 0040 and 0440, the latter before `griddepcontrol.wait`; Apache-2.0) and knapcio's `GLM_L2_PREFETCH`; compare mmastrac's arx L2 prefetch during all-reduce waits. Our notes do not record which prompted it | Discarded byte loads from the kernel's own CTAs; measured against our own nsys wait gaps |
| mHC seam weight touch (`ATLAS_GLM_STEP_FUSE` group 2) | `glm_hc_decode_{post_,}partial_rows_touch_bf16` in `kernels/gb10/glm-5.3-flash/nvfp4/glm_hc_prefill_vec.cu`, `layers/ops/glm_step_fuse.rs` | The PDL weight touch above (TensorFold's L2 weight touch, [jayleaton/glm53-tensorfold-spark](https://github.com/jayleaton/glm53-tensorfold-spark) patch 0440; Apache-2.0). MiaAI-Lab's TensorFold recipe patch `0046-glm-l2-prefetch` (`TF_GLM_L2PF`; Apache-2.0) likewise reads a seam's next weights into L2 while the previous site's partials are gathered | The 1.5 MiB FP32 `hc_fn` of each seam, touched by the partial kernel's own CTAs before their PDL wait |
| Prefill indexer row split (`ATLAS_GLM_INDEX_SPLIT`) | `qwen3_attention/prefill/glm_index_split*.rs`, `scripts/dev/glm_index_split_bench.cu` | RiNGSiDE's `GLM53_INDEXER_ROW_SPLIT` (othexmr, [GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-2x-4x-DGX-Sparks-RiNGSiDE](https://github.com/othexmr/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4-2x-4x-DGX-Sparks-RiNGSiDE) `src/tp4/glm53_indexer_rowsplit.py`; Apache-2.0), itself after rhys101's SG18 prefill TP split and knapcio's DeepSeek-V4.1 TP4 adaptation | Zigzag quarters for equal causal work, the swap over the RDMA pair, the row-subset proof |
| Drafter split across ranks (`ATLAS_GLM_DRAFT_TP`) | `dflash_head/rank_split.rs` | MiaAI-Lab's `DFLASH_DRAFT_TP=2` ([GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks) `.env.example`, `start.sh`; vLLM `draft_tensor_parallel_size`) | Output-row share on 16-row CTA boundaries, swapped over the pair, bit-identical drafts |
| KDA fold-record rollback (`--ssm-rollback-mode records`) | `model/ssm_pool/kda_records.rs`, `kda_recurrent_bf16_verify_rec_owners` / `kda_commit_records` in `kernels/gb10/glm-5.3-flash/nvfp4/kda.cu` | vLLM RecoverSSM ([vllm#51855](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/51855), ZJY0516 with benchislett), from ReplaySSM ([vllm#48018](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/48018), Johnny-Liou, Dao AI Lab, NVIDIA), as RiNGSiDE ships it for GLM-5.3 (`--use-replayssm`); Apache-2.0 | CUDA kernels on our snapshot-verify template, our record layout (decays, normalized keys, corrections) and one fold rounding order shared by verify and commit |
| SSM snapshot chain eviction | `spark-runtime/src/radix_tree/snapshot_chain.rs` | Reederey87's prefix-cache overlays (Artem Matskevych, [glm53-flash-exl3-2x-dgx-spark](https://github.com/Reederey87/glm53-flash-exl3-2x-dgx-spark) `overlay/patch_apc_tail_boundary.py`, `cache_tail_evict.py`, `patch_cache_hot_protect.py`; Apache-2.0); branch points from Marconi (MLSys'25, arXiv:2411.19379) | The chain / superseded / one-protected-slot-per-session policy |

## Related work, not derived from

- Token-sharded MLA latents (`docs/glm-kv-shard.md`): vLLM decode context
  parallelism (`decode_context_parallel_size`, Apache-2.0) also shards KV
  by token. The design came from our own 512K x 4 pool target.
- NVMe prefix cache (`docs/glm-nvme-prefix-cache.md`): MiaAI-Lab
  [PR #232](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks/pull/232)
  (`overlay/kvoffload/nvme_direct.py`) offloads vLLM prefix blocks to NVMe,
  one file per chunk. Ours spills radix evictions into a reserved O_DIRECT
  record file.
