# `glm5_next` — GLM-5.3-Flash on GB10: current status

**Current (2026-10-10).** GLM-5.3-Flash is released as the Enntity snapshot
`sparkglm/atlas-20261009-rc2` (`f2b805e7`), tree-equivalent with
`sparkglm/atlas-20261009-rc2-layered` (`fea1ef6c`), both at tree `513bf0c7`.
Port notes, recipes, and measured results live in
[`Enntity/sparkglm`](https://github.com/Enntity/sparkglm); see
[`docs/PUBLISHED_RELEASES.md`](../PUBLISHED_RELEASES.md) for the release index
and the tested scope. Everything below the horizontal rule is dated historical
port notes, kept as written.

## Dated historical port notes (2026-09-28)

At the date of these notes the port was in progress and not yet in-tree.
Tracking issue: #59. Target checkpoint:
[`nvidia/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4).
This file lands with the first GLM PR and is updated in place as each PR in the
series merges. Every number here is either measured on the tree it names or is
marked as pending.

## The headline constraint: two Sparks minimum

GLM-5.3-Flash has 320B total parameters, of which 18B are active per token. At NVFP4, the weights take about 180 GB. A single GB10 has about 119 GB of unified memory. The minimum topology is therefore EP2 across two Sparks, as with the DeepSeek-V4-Flash EP2 recipe.

## Architecture

| Piece | Shape | Atlas building block |
|---|---|---|
| Layers | 45: 34 linear-attention (KDA) + 11 full-attention (MLA) | hybrid SSM/attention runtime (ADR-0003) |
| Linear attention | Kimi Delta Attention, 64 heads x 128, short conv 4, FP32 recurrent state | SSM state pool; new KDA kernels |
| Full attention | MLA, `kv_lora_rank` 512, sparse top-2048 selection from a semantic indexer above 2048 tokens; exact dense MLA below | MLA runtime shared with DeepSeek-V4-Flash |
| Residual | mHC hyper-connections, `hc_mult` 4, 20 Sinkhorn iterations | DeepSeek-V4-Flash mHC kernels |
| MoE | 288 routed experts, top-8, sigmoid `noaux_tc` routing, one shared expert; the first `first_k_dense_replace` layers are dense | NVFP4 grouped MoE |
| Vocab | 154,880 | |
| MTP | extra decoder layers appended to the checkpoint | follow-up job |
| Vision | vision tower present in the checkpoint | follow-up; image input refused at pre-flight until then |

Tool calls use the existing `poolside_v1` parser.

## Series plan

| PR | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1a | parser, NVIDIA ModelOpt loader, KDA, MLA up to 2048 tokens, EP2, kernel tree `kernels/gb10/glm-5.3-flash/` | in preparation |
| 1b | semantic indexer (long context), `BENCH.toml`, `bfcl-subset` (ST-995) | pending |
| 2 | prefill levers, one A/B each | pending |
| later | decode concurrency, fp8 latent KV, MTP, DFlash2 on the upstream DFlash2 lane, vision | follow-up jobs |

## Provenance and credits

**Authors**
- **Reiner Schmidt ([@Mango-kid](https://github.com/Mango-kid))** wrote the original Atlas port: [`Mango-kid/atlas` `feat/glm53-dual-spark`](https://github.com/Mango-kid/atlas/tree/feat/glm53-dual-spark) @ `90b3584a`, AGPL-3.0-only. It includes the `glm5_next` parser, weight loader, KDA layers and kernels, the GLM indexer, and native MTP.
- **Jason McCartney ([@data-angel](https://github.com/data-angel), Enntity)** extended it in the Enntity GLM work, first published as the now-historical `sparkglm/installable-20260924` snapshot and since released as `sparkglm/atlas-20261009-rc2` (see [`docs/PUBLISHED_RELEASES.md`](../PUBLISHED_RELEASES.md)), AGPL-3.0-only. The work covers the NVIDIA ModelOpt dense-FFN loader, sparse-MLA decode and prefill kernels, MoE prefill, fp8 latent KV, and DFlash2 integration. Current release receipts: [SparkGLM RC2](https://github.com/Enntity/sparkglm/blob/main/results/2026-10-09-rc2/RESULT.md).
- **AI assistance.** Both branches were written largely by AI coding agents under their authors' direction: Claude and Codex for the Enntity work, and agent-written work in Reiner's branch. The PRs in this series are ported by Claude. Commits that carry Reiner's code credit him with `Co-authored-by`.
