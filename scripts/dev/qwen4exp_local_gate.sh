# Local verification gate for the qwen4_exp port — no GPU, no nvcc, no CUDA.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The GB10 is not always reachable (it lives on a mesh VPN),
# and this port touches 99 files across five crates. Without a gate, "it
# compiles on my machine" means the metal build only, which is the one
# configuration the qwen4_exp code is almost entirely absent from — nearly all
# of it sits behind `#[cfg(feature = "cuda")]`.
#
# THE TWO ENV VARS ARE THE WHOLE TRICK:
#
#   ATLAS_SKIP_BUILD=1        atlas-kernels' build.rs writes a type-checkable
#                             stub instead of invoking nvcc, so the CUDA Rust
#                             path compiles with no toolkit present. Nothing is
#                             compiled to PTX, so this gate says NOTHING about
#                             the .cu files themselves.
#   CUDARC_CUDA_VERSION=13000 stops the vendored cudarc's build.rs shelling out
#                             to `nvcc --version` to discover a version.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO, stated so nobody reads a PASS as more than it is:
#   * no kernel is compiled, so a .cu syntax or arity error is invisible here;
#   * no kernel is RUN, so every parity test is `#[ignore]`d and unexecuted;
#   * anything that links `-lcuda` cannot even build a test binary on macOS,
#     which is why the test rows below run under `metal` — the tests
#     themselves are backend-agnostic, the linking is not.
#
# On Linux with a real toolchain, drop both env vars and the `metal` features
# and this is just the ordinary gate.
