//! `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next` (`qwen4_exp`) weight loader. Port tracked in Avarok
//! #753.
//!
//! **This serves.** Every mechanism the module doc below once listed as
//! missing has shipped; the file is annotated with what each one is validated
//! against, because the failure mode for all of them is fluent-and-wrong.
//!
//! * **mHC low-rank highway** — all 48 layers.
//!   `ops/hyper_connection_lowrank_tests.rs` runs the four entry points on the
//!   GPU against a golden taken from the real `Qwen4ExpTextGatedResidual` on
//!   real checkpoint weights: cos 0.999998, `hc_post` bit-exact, and the two
//!   defects the harness exists to catch (a global instead of grouped RMS, and
//!   the dropped offset-from-1) fail it by three orders of magnitude.
//! * **PLE n-gram injection** at model layer 1 — wired, with the ~320M-row
//!   table read by row off NVMe (`NgramRowCache::open_segmented`; the 128
//!   shards are NOT contiguous, so one base offset would read wrong-but-valid
//!   rows silently). `ATLAS_QWEN4EXP_NO_PLE=1` now DISABLES a mechanism that
//!   is present, for bisecting the mHC spine, and says so loudly.
//! * **The QSA indexer** — decode-side selection plus per-query prefill
//!   selection, both parity-gated at T=2200 where selection actively prunes.
//!   Provably inert at or below `indexer_budget`, so short contexts are exact
//!   rather than approximate.
//! * **Batched / multi-sequence decode** — honoured. Per-sequence PLE and QSA
//!   state ride the layer states, and the earlier clamp-to-1 is lifted.
//!
//! * **MTP** — honoured, through `mtp::load_qwen4exp_mtp_module` rather than
//!   the family `load_mtp_weights` below, which still returns `None` because
//!   this block is not the `MtpWeights` shape. It loads, proposes and verifies
//!   on the mHC highway; it is simply slower than plain decode on this model
//!   (see `kernels/gb10/qwen3.8-flash-next/MODEL.toml` for the numbers).
//!
//! Still refused: the **stacked expert layout**, which neither published
//! release uses.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS MOSTLY qwen35's LOADER. Qwen3.8-Flash-Next and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
//! share far more than the version numbers suggest: 3:1 GDN/full-attention
//! interleave, MoE with a shared expert, gated attention, mRoPE, a ViT tower,
//! vocab 248320, rope_theta 1e7, head_dim 256, partial rotary 0.25, and the
//! same GDN key geometry. Critically, `load_ssm_qwen35` already reads
//! `in_proj_qkv` and `in_proj_z` as SEPARATE tensors and concatenates them —
//! which is exactly this model's layout, not a coincidence to be re-derived.
//! So the GDN and full-attention arms are called directly, with
//! `config.weight_prefix = "model.language_model"` making
//! `config.layer_prefix(i)` yield the real keys.
//!
//! WHAT IS GENUINELY DIFFERENT, and why each needs care:
//!
//! 1. **There are no per-layer norms.** No `input_layernorm`, no
//!    `post_attention_layernorm`, no final `model.norm`. Normalization lives
//!    inside the hyper-connection blocks as `hc_norm [hc_mult*hidden]`, and
//!    the model-level `hyper_connection_mixer` — which collapses the streams
//!    back to one before `lm_head` — carries the final norm. A loader that
//!    "helpfully" defaults these would be inventing weights.
//! 2. **mHC is 4 residual streams**, mixed low-rank (rank 320). Atlas's mHC
//!    plumbing is DeepSeek-V4's, whose mixer is Sinkhorn-normalized — same
//!    stream layout, different math.
//! 3. **A QSA indexer** on the 12 full-attention layers.
//! 4. **PLE n-gram injection** at one layer, off a ~320M-row table served
//!    from NVMe rather than resident.
