//! Qwen3.8-Flash-Next Multi-Token-Prediction (MTP) draft-module loader.
//!
//! The checkpoint DOES ship MTP: 31 tensors, 5.21 GB of BF16 under `mtp.*`.
//! v1 declined them (`load_mtp_weights` returned `None`) on the reading that
//! the block was "effectively a second model". Measured against the tensor
//! index, that reading was too pessimistic on every count:
//!
//!   * The block is **shape-identical to a main full-attention layer** — the
//!     `q/k/v/o` projections, `q_norm`/`k_norm`, the QSA indexer, the MoE
//!     router and the shared expert all match `model.language_model.layers.11`
//!     tensor for tensor, all BF16. So [`build_full_attention_nvfp4`] builds
//!     the body unchanged; nothing about the attention arm is MTP-specific.
//!   * The mHC sites are named exactly like a main layer's
//!     (`{lp}.attn_hyper_connection`, `{lp}.mlp_hyper_connection`), so
//!     [`hc::load_layer_sites`] reads them with `lp = "mtp.layers.0"` as-is.
//!   * The "stacked expert layout" already had a zero-copy slicer
//!     ([`load_mtp_experts_stacked`]); it wants exactly the `[E, 2I, H]` /
//!     `[E, H, I]` pair this checkpoint ships.
//!   * `fc_embedding`/`fc_hidden` against a fused `eh_proj` is a concat, not a
//!     redesign: `fc(concat(e, h)) == fc_embedding·e + fc_hidden·h`.
//!
//! What is genuinely different is the MoE **storage**: the main layers ship
//! per-expert NVFP4 (packed E2M1), the MTP block ships two stacked BF16
//! tensors. [`build_mtp_moe`] slices and requantizes them so the body gets the
//! same [`MoeLayer`] every other layer gets.
//!
//! ## Forward (supplied by the proposer, not here)
//!
//! ```text
//!   n_h   = rms_norm(target_final_hc_streams, pre_fc_norm_hidden)  // [4*H]
//!   h_c   = collapse(n_h)                                          // 4*H -> H
//!   n_e   = rms_norm(embed[last_token], pre_fc_norm_embedding)     // [H]
//!   h_in  = fc_embedding·n_e + fc_hidden·h_c
//!   s     = hc_expand(h_in)                                        // -> 4 streams
//!   s     = body.decode(s, ..., mtp_kv_cache)                      // MIDDLE mHC
//!   h_out = hc_head(s)                                             // mtp.hyper_connection_mixer
//!   logits = lm_head(h_out)                                        // SHARED head
//! ```
//!
//! Two absences in the checkpoint pin that ordering down. There is no
//! `mtp.norm.weight` and no `input_layernorm`/`post_attention_layernorm` on
//! `mtp.layers.0` — because in this architecture the mixer's `hc_norm` IS the
//! final norm (the main model ships no `model.norm.weight` for the same
//! reason) and each mHC site carries its own `hc_norm`. So the mixer belongs
//! at the END, as the collapse-plus-final-norm, exactly as DeepSeek-V4's MTP
//! module does it.
//!
//! The body is assembled with `layer_idx = num_hidden_layers`, which makes its
//! mHC forward run the MIDDLE mixing only (`hc_pre` -> attn -> `hc_post` ->
//! `hc_pre` -> MoE -> `hc_post`): it calls neither `hc_expand` nor `hc_head`.
//! The proposer supplies both ends. See `weight_loader/deepseek_v4/mtp.rs`,
//! which is the same story on the V4 checkpoint.
