//! How many bytes `build_model` may give the paged KV cache.
//!
//! The user-facing contract (vLLM / sparkrun convention) is that
//! `total × --gpu-memory-utilization` is the ceiling on everything THIS
//! process holds. The KV pool gets what is left of that ceiling after the
//! process's own pre-KV footprint and the reserves. Co-tenants (GB10 is
//! shared: ComfyUI, voice, a docker build) are excluded, so a low utilization
//! does not starve the pool for memory Atlas never took.
//!
//! **Own footprint** is the larger of two measures:
//!
//! 1. Free memory at context init minus free memory now
//!    (`gpu::baseline_free_bytes`), or, when
//!    `ATLAS_KV_EXTERNAL_RESERVE_GB` is set, raw used minus that figure.
//!    Exact while co-tenants hold still. When one RELEASES memory during the
//!    load, that memory is credited to Atlas as footprint it never had and
//!    the pool is sized into it: on 2026-09-30 two ranks read 100.1 and
//!    97.9 GiB for a process that holds 102.3, the pool came out 2.1 GiB
//!    large, and the host ran out of unified memory two requests later.
//! 2. What the process itself allocated (`GpuBackend::own_footprint`):
//!    nothing another process does can lower it. This is what fixes the
//!    defect, and only when its device figure is the driver's accounting. The
//!    allocation ledger it falls back to is a lower bound that can miss as
//!    much as a co-tenant releases; that case is a WARN and a larger headroom.
//!
//! A co-tenant that ALLOCATES during the load inflates (1), and a counter
//! that misses something deflates (2); either way the larger one is kept, so
//! the estimate errs toward a smaller pool. A tracked figure above everything
//! in use on the device is an over-count and is charged as everything in use.
//! The two are logged side by side and a gap over [`DISAGREE_WARN_BYTES`] is a
//! WARN.
//!
//! **Headroom floor.** The process keeps growing after sizing (CUDA graphs,
//! JIT, lazy buffers): on the GB10 TP2 reference start by about 2.9 GiB, 2.0
//! of it beyond the 0.9 GiB of reserves. So whatever was measured, the pool
//! leaves the reserves plus [`HEADROOM_BYTES`] of what is free now. The
//! headroom is an absolute size because that growth is; it is capped at the
//! memory the operator left outside the utilization ceiling, so a device
//! Atlas has to itself is sized exactly as before at every utilization.
//!
//! The floor is a backstop, not the fix. It bounds what a mis-measured
//! footprint can cost (free-now is read directly) and keeps co-tenants from
//! filling the margin a growing process needs, but a start it binds settles
//! about 1.5 GiB above empty on the reference pair, where a normal start
//! settles at 2.0. The reference start (4.6 GiB of co-tenants, 3.9 GiB left
//! beyond the reserves) is 0.4 GiB clear of it.
