//! DFlash block-diffusion draft head implementing [`DraftProposer`].
//!
//! Block-diffusion drafter (Z Lab, arXiv 2602.06036): a small Qwen3-architecture
//! transformer (8 layers, hidden=2048, GQA 32:4, head_dim=128) that emits γ=16
//! tokens **in a single forward pass** via bidirectional in-block attention.
//! Conditioned on five intermediate hidden states captured from the target
//! model at `target_layer_ids` (e.g., `[1, 10, 19, 28, 37]` for
//! Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-DFlash), projected through a single `fc` layer at model
//! entry — NOT per-layer KV injection (early plan was wrong; cf. vLLM
//! `qwen3_dflash.py`).
//!
//! Phase 1 deliverable: type + trait wiring. The actual γ-block forward kernel
//! (`inferspark_dflash_block_attn_fp8`) lands in Phase 2; until then `propose()`
//! returns the bonus token repeated `num_drafts` times so the verify path
//! degenerates to single-token decode (acceptance ~100% but no speedup).
