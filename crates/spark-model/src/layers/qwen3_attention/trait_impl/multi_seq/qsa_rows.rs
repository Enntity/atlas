//! QSA on the batched multi-row path: the per-row indexer walk.
//!
//! A multi-row step (a speculative verify: K drafts + the committed token,
//! all owned by ONE sequence) attends every row in one forward. Past the
//! inert bound each row needs its OWN selection, cut at its own position:
//! row `i` must see exactly what a serial decode step at that position would
//! — the drafts before it, none after it, and any block those drafts closed.
//! One selection shared by the window is a different function
//! (`atlas-core` `qsa_tests::one_shared_selection_cannot_serve_a_verify_window`).
//!
//! So this phase IS R serial steps of the indexer, in row order, through the
//! same `decode_select` and the same bs=1 selected attention the serial path
//! uses. Indexer state after the step therefore equals serial state by
//! construction, and `QsaIndexer::rewind_verify` stays exact.
//!
//! THE INVARIANT: select -> gather -> attend is completed (enqueued) for row
//! `i` BEFORE `decode_select` runs for row `i + 1`. A `QsaSelection` points
//! at LAYER-OWNED scratch that the next `decode_select` overwrites; selecting
//! for all rows first and attending afterwards would make every row attend
//! over the last row's set — plausible-looking and silent. All launches go to
//! one stream, so enqueue order is execution order.
//!
//! Cost: indexer scoring, top-k, gather and selected attention are paid once
//! per row, exactly as R serial steps would pay them; the step still batches
//! everything outside this phase. Rows still INSIDE the bound (a window that
//! straddles it) take the dense bs=1 attention, as serial decode does.
