//! Batched (K-token, one sequence) GDN decode under the mHC highway — the
//! piece `refuse_batched_under_hc` guarded for `decode_batched` (#753 item B).
//!
//! This is the path a speculative VERIFY step needs: K consecutive tokens of a
//! single sequence in one forward. It is not the same problem as
//! `trait_decode_multi_seq/hc.rs`, which was already built — there the rows are
//! N independent sequences with independent SSM states, so the recurrence runs
//! per row. Here the K rows are sequentially dependent within one sequence, and
//! the conv/GDN body must scan them in order against one state.
//!
//! ## Why only the two ends change
//!
//! The non-hc `decode_batched_inner` is steps 1..10, and only three of them
//! touch the residual:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1.  rms_norm_residual(hidden, input_norm)      -> normed, residual
//!   2-9 the conv/GDN body                          -> out_proj_buf
//!   10. residual_add_rms_norm(hidden, out_proj_buf, post_attn_norm)
//!       ffn(normed2) -> moe_output
//!       residual_add(hidden, moe_output)
//! ```
//!
//! Under the highway those three are exactly what must NOT run: `hc_pre` is
//! the norm (the checkpoint ships no per-layer norms — the loader's
//! ones-placeholders would not make a second RMS pass an identity), and the
//! block output reaches the residual only through `hc_post`, scaled per stream
//! by the injection vector `hc_pre` emitted. Running them anyway adds each
//! block output a second time, which is the "plausible, wrong activations with
//! nothing in the log" the refusal existed to prevent.
//!
//! Steps 2-9 are untouched and shared verbatim: they read `normed` and write
//! `out_proj_buf` and never look at the residual. So this file supplies the
//! two ends and the caller keeps the body.
//!
//! Shape, mirroring `trait_prefill_hc.rs` at K tokens instead of a chunk:
//!
//! ```text
//!   hc_expand [K]                    (first model layer only)
//!   PLE [K]                          (the one layer that carries it)
//!   hc_pre(attn) -> normed           <- steps 2-9 read this
//!     ... conv/GDN body ...          -> out_proj_buf
//!   hc_post(out_proj_buf -> streams)
//!   hc_pre(ffn)  -> normed2
//!     MoE                            -> moe_output
//!   hc_post(moe_output -> streams)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Rollback is not this file's problem
//!
//! Partial acceptance rolls the SSM state back through the per-token
//! checkpoints (`conv_intermediate` / `h_checkpoint`), whose destinations the
//! MODEL stages into the layer state (`model/trait_impl/meta.rs`) and whose
//! writes happen inside the shared conv/GDN body. Since that body is reused
//! unchanged, checkpointing behaves exactly as on the non-hc path.
