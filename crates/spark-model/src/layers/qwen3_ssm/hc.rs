//! mHC on the GDN layer.
//!
//! Qwen3.8-Flash-Next carries a `hc_mult`-wide residual highway on ALL 48
//! layers, 36 of which are GDN. DeepSeek-V4 — the model Atlas built mHC for —
//! is all-attention, so `Qwen3SsmLayer` never needed to know about it.
//!
//! The forward paths live in `trait_prefill_hc.rs` and `trait_decode_hc.rs`;
//! `trait_layer.rs` routes to them when `hc` is present. What is left here is
//! attachment and the one refusal that remains.
