//! GPU parity for the qwen4_exp SERVING kernels against the in-process CPU
//! oracle — no checkpoint, no Python, no fixture files.
//!
//! There is already a parity gate for these kernels
//! (`hyper_connection_lowrank_tests.rs`), and it is the stronger evidence:
//! its fixtures come from the real `Qwen4ExpTextGatedResidual` running on real
//! checkpoint weights, so agreement there chains to HuggingFace. But it needs
//! a 126 GiB checkpoint, `transformers`, and a generated `--bin-dir` before it
//! can say anything at all. On a fresh box that is a morning of setup before
//! the first number.
//!
//! This file closes that gap from the other side. `atlas_core::qwen4exp_reference`
//! is a Rust transcription of the same reference module, and it is itself
//! checked against HuggingFace at real weights (hyper-connections 1.6e-7). So
//! driving the kernels against IT gives a gate that runs from a clean
//! checkout with one command:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p spark-model --release qwen4exp_oracle -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! What this can and cannot catch, stated plainly: the oracle and the kernel
//! were written by different people from the same source document, so they
//! agree only if both read it the same way — which is the whole point. What it
//! CANNOT catch is a shared misreading, and that is exactly what the
//! checkpoint-backed golden is for. Run both.
//!
//! Every check carries a control that must FAIL, because a parity test that
//! cannot fail proves nothing.
