//! End-of-turn SSM snapshot on a block boundary
//! (`ATLAS_GLM_PC_FINISH_LEAF=1`, default off).
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! A prefill saves one SSM checkpoint, a block or two below the prompt end.
//! The next turn of the conversation restores it and re-prefills everything
//! after it: the gap to the prompt end, all of the previous turn's output and
//! the new message. With this flag the sequence also keeps the state it had
//! at the last save boundary its decode crossed (its leaf), and the next turn
//! restores there instead.
//!
//! # Why the older leaves were wrong
//!
//! The finish leaf (`finish_leaf_snapshot`) copies the LIVE state at finish
//! and labels it `seq.tokens.len()`. Production turns it off, along with the
//! prompt-end and decode-cadence snapshots (`ATLAS_MARCONI_PREFILL_ONLY`),
//! because restores gave wrong answers. What the code shows:
//!
//! 1. *Position.* A verify step that finished the sequence returned before
//!    its commit (fixed separately), so the head's state was not the state
//!    at `seq.tokens.len()`: with KDA records the h state had none of the
//!    step's rows, the conv state had all `k` rows including the rejected
//!    drafts, and the aux rewind had not run.
//! 2. *Rank symmetry.* `cache_sequence` runs on the head only, so only the
//!    head held the leaf. It came into reach two turns later (its blocks
//!    are then prompt blocks), and when the message in between was shorter
//!    than the 17-32 token tail gap it was the head's deepest snapshot while
//!    the worker's was the prefill checkpoint: two restore depths, so every
//!    TP collective paired one rank's row `i` with the other rank's row
//!    `i + d`. The extra head-only snapshots also made the two 16-slot pools
//!    evict different victims, which desynchronizes restores of any kind.
//! 3. *Alignment.* `seq.tokens.len()` is rarely a block boundary and a lookup
//!    only returns snapshots at or below its block-aligned match, so the
//!    leaf could not serve the turn it was saved for. With sub-block matching
//!    it would pair with a partial block whose tail holds rejected rows.
//! 4. *Reachability.* The radix insert at finish left the block under the
//!    prompt end without a sequence reference (see [`owned_from`]), so no
//!    block of the generated output was ever matched by the next turn.
//!
//! The prompt-end leaf is exact as saved (both ranks, end of prefill), but it
//! sits mid-block 17-32 tokens above the tail checkpoint and buys at most
//! that, so it stays off.
//!
//! # What this does instead
//!
//! The state is saved at the moment it is exactly on a boundary, by model
//! code that both ranks run from rank-identical inputs:
//!
//! * A records commit folds the accepted rows of a verify step into the h
//!   state one row at a time. When the step crosses a boundary the fold is
//!   issued in two launches, to the boundary and from it, with the save
//!   between. `kda_commit_records` applies the same per-row fold from and to
//!   FP32 memory, so the split is bit-identical to the single launch. The
//!   conv state at the boundary is the verify's own snapshot after that row.
//! * A plain decode step advances the state in place by one token, so the
//!   live state is the boundary state whenever the new length is a boundary.
//!
//! The save reuses one Marconi snapshot slot per sequence (a rolling slot),
//! so a turn costs one slot however long it is. At finish the head tells the
//! worker to cache its mirror of the sequence too ([`EP_CMD_CACHE_SEQUENCE`]),
//! which is what brings the leaf into reach: a lookup only returns a snapshot
//! at or below its block match, and the blocks of the output are cached at
//! finish. A restore goes through the usual gate plus the restore-depth rank
//! agreement (`pc_policy`), so a rank that lost its copy makes both ranks
//! fall back together.
//!
//! # The snapshot pool
//!
//! A leaf serves one turn of one conversation, and only if that turn's prompt
//! reproduces the output up to the boundary (not a reasoning turn whose
//! history drops the thinking, nor a client that re-renders the output). So
//! it is a second-class entry (`spark_runtime::radix_tree`, `snapshot_leaf`)
//! and it never costs a conversation a checkpoint:
//!
//! * The rolling slot is registered as a leaf from its first save and moved
//!   boundary by boundary. No slot is held outside the index: a prefill
//!   checkpoint that needs a slot takes any leaf, a decoding sequence's
//!   included, before it takes a frontier. The sequence asks for its slot
//!   back before each save and takes another when it is gone.
//! * A rolling slot comes from the free list, from superseded history or
//!   from another leaf. It never evicts a conversation's frontier checkpoint
//!   or a branch point; when none of the three is available the turn takes
//!   no leaf.
//! * A leaf does not supersede the prefill checkpoint under it, which stays
//!   the conversation's protected restore point.
//! * The turn that restores a leaf settles it
//!   ([`TransformerModel::finish_leaf_restored`]). Normally it saves a tail
//!   checkpoint of its own and the leaf becomes superseded history, which
//!   that save and the turn's own rolling slot then reuse. A turn that
//!   restores at or above its tail cut saves no checkpoint (its new message
//!   is shorter than the tail gap), and the leaf is promoted to one.
//!
//! # Stream order
//!
//! A leaf's slot can change hands between two writes (evicted, then reused
//! by a tail checkpoint or by another sequence's leaf) and the writes come
//! from different streams: the secondary stream for a verify commit, the
//! default stream for a plain decode, the prefill stream for a checkpoint
//! and for a restore's read. With the flag on every one of them waits on the
//! snapshot event before it touches a slot and records it after, so they
//! form one order whatever the streams.
//!
//! # Preconditions
//!
//! The flag is ignored with a warning unless all of these hold:
//!
//! * `ATLAS_PREFIX_SUBBLOCK=0`: the leaf only pairs with a whole-block match.
//! * `ATLAS_MARCONI_PREFILL_ONLY=1`: the legacy leaves above stay off.
//! * `ATLAS_GLM_PC_EVICT=1`: the rules above are classes of the chain-aware
//!   victim, which also makes both ranks choose victims the same way (it
//!   does not use `session_hash`, which only the head knows).
//!
//! # Numerics
//!
//! Exact, but not the bits a cold prefill of the same prompt produces. The
//! restored state and the KV rows of the previous turn's output come from the
//! decode kernels that generated that output (the state the model really
//! had), where the flag-off path recomputes both with the prefill kernels.
//! The next prefill also starts at a different row, so its pass shapes differ
//! (see the accumulation-order note in `pc_policy`).
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! One D2D copy of the sequence's SSM state per rank (74 MiB; about 3 ms in
//! `scripts/finish-leaf-bench`, a preliminary standalone reading on a shared
//! GB10) each time decode crosses a save boundary
//! (`ATLAS_GLM_PC_FINISH_LEAF_BLOCKS` blocks apart, default 4), on the stream
//! that advanced the state. For a verify commit that is the secondary
//! stream, where the copy overlaps the head's next propose. A plain decode
//! step saves on the default stream ahead of its logits read, so there the
//! copy is not hidden. Every request pays it, including the ones whose leaf
//! is never restored. The DFlash drafter's context on the next turn shrinks
//! with the re-prefill it replaces (it is filled from the rows a prefill
//! processes); a wider span keeps more of it.
//!
//! # Rank env parity
//!
//! Both ranks must run with the same `ATLAS_GLM_PC_FINISH_LEAF`,
//! `ATLAS_GLM_PC_FINISH_LEAF_BLOCKS` and the three variables above. The flag
//! itself adds no collective (a mismatch in it or in the span loses restores
//! and logs an error on the worker, it does not hang), but
//! `ATLAS_GLM_PC_EVICT` does (see "Rank env parity" in `pc_policy`). The
//! ranks compare all of them at startup (`model::startup_parity`).
//!
//! # Known limits
//!
//! * A preempted sequence is cached through the same command and resumes
//!   through `Model::prefill`, which takes no rank agreement (as in base,
//!   where the worker resumes through the chunk path) and does not take part
//!   in the stream order above. Keep the flag off where preemption can run
//!   (`--swap-space-gb` above 0) until resume takes the chunk path.
//! * The spill tier (`ATLAS_SSM_TIER`) reads slots outside that order too,
//!   and would spill leaves it should drop. Keep it off with the flag.
