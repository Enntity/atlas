//! The deferred GDN commit fused into the next verify
//! (`ATLAS_QWEN4EXP_GDN_COMMIT_FUSE=1`, default off; needs
//! `ATLAS_QWEN4EXP_EXACT_DEFER`).
//!
//! Under the exact deferral (`layers/ops/qwen4exp_gdn_defer.rs`) a verify
//! reads H0 and stages its rows' inputs, and after the verdict
//! `qwen4exp_gdn_commit_layers` replays the accepted prefix from H0: a second
//! read of every sequence's state and its write, ~4.5 ms a C8 step on the
//! secondary stream, where it takes the SMs from the next propose (nsys,
//! 2026-10-07). Fused, the verdict launches nothing: it leaves the commit
//! PENDING (`n` accepted tokens, the layers' state and staging), and the
//! sequence's next deferred verify replays those `n` tokens first, stores the
//! committed state once and verifies its own rows from the registers
//! (`qwen4exp_gdn_verify_defer_rows`, `fuse_n`). The replay is the commit
//! kernel's loop verbatim on the same inputs, so the stored bytes are the
//! commit's and the verify reads the floats it would have reloaded:
//! `scripts/dev/qwen4exp_gdn_defer_bench.cu` (defer-check) holds both.
//!
//! The kernel learns `n` from the slot's pending-commit word
//! (`SsmStatePool::fuse_word`, a pointer the verify graphs bake). Every
//! deferred verify sets it ([`TransformerModel::gdn_fuse_arm`], at the
//! dispatch entry where the pending flags are set): `n` when the step defers
//! exactly the layers the pending commit holds, else the commit runs on its
//! own first and the word is 0.
//!
//! Anything else that reads or writes a pending sequence's GDN state first
//! FLUSHES (the standalone commit, then a stream sync so any stream sees the
//! state): every forward that is not a deferred verify (prefill, decode,
//! mixed, rollback, checkpoints), the snapshot / leaf / prefix-cache saves
//! and slot moves (`sync_secondary_dispatch`, the point they already order
//! after the commit at), state save/restore, and on the EP worker every
//! command but the batched verify and the draft-assist walk. A freed
//! sequence's pending commit is dropped. Ranks decide independently: GDN
//! state is rank-local and both forms land the same bytes.
