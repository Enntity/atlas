//! Prefix-cache snapshot policy for hybrid SSM models: the restore-depth rank
//! agreement and branch-point checkpoints.
//!
//! # Branch-point checkpoints (`ATLAS_GLM_PC_BRANCH=1`, default off)
//!
//! A prefill saves one SSM checkpoint per turn: the tail split, one block
//! below the last block boundary under the prompt end. That serves the next
//! turn of the SAME conversation. A NEW conversation that shares a long
//! prefix with an earlier one (agentic clients: the same 20-60K-token system
//! prompt and tool list in every session, subagent and side request) matches
//! that prefix in the KV radix but finds no snapshot at or near the match,
//! because every existing snapshot sits at some other conversation's tail. It
//! then recomputes all of it ("Prefix cache hit: N tokens but no SSM snapshot
//! — recomputing all KV"), or replays from a much shallower snapshot.
//!
//! With the flag, a prefill whose radix match `matched` lies at least
//! `ATLAS_GLM_PC_BRANCH_MIN` tokens (default 2048) above its restore depth,
//! below the tail cut, and exactly where the cached KV path forks (another
//! cached request continues past `matched` with a different block, on every
//! rank) splits the chunk that spans `matched` and saves a checkpoint there.
//! The next request with that prefix restores it and replays only its own
//! suffix. This is Marconi's branch-point admission (MLSys'25,
//! arXiv:2411.19379). The checkpoint is an ordinary block-aligned prefill
//! checkpoint, so it stays valid under `ATLAS_MARCONI_PREFILL_ONLY`. The
//! cost is one extra prefill pass, paid once per shared prefix by the first
//! request that finds the fork. The fork test keeps the pass off a
//! conversation's own next turn: its match ends where its own cached path
//! ends, which is not a fork. (A reasoning turn whose re-rendered history
//! drops the decoded thinking does fork there, but its own tail checkpoint
//! sits within two blocks of the match, far under the minimum.)
//!
//! ## Accumulation order (lossless, but cache-dependent)
//!
//! The split is the same math and the same kernels, but NOT the same
//! accumulation order as the unsplit pass. The request that plants the
//! checkpoint runs `[start, at)` and `[at, end)` as two passes where a cold
//! run of the same prompt runs one, so every row from `at` on sees different
//! GEMM M-shapes, MoE groupings, attention tiling over the cached prefix, KDA
//! pieces (`glm5_kda::flash_prefill` splits a pass into near-equal pieces by
//! its row count) and SP row halves. Its output can differ bitwise from a
//! cold run, and a near-tied greedy argmax can flip, exactly as for any
//! Marconi intermediate restore (the requests that later restore at `at` run
//! the same `[at, end)` shape). Base makes the chunk shape a pure function of
//! (tokens, config) for this reason (`prefill_chunk_dispatch`, tail split);
//! this flag deliberately trades that for the shared-prefix restore. No
//! alignment of `at` can restore the unsplit shape, since the KDA piece
//! layout depends on the pass length.
//!
//! # Restore-depth rank agreement
//!
//! TP2 ranks keep their own snapshot pools and indexes. Only the radix match
//! is min-reduced across ranks (F83), and the Marconi restore depth sets each
//! rank's processed row range, so ranks that restore at different depths run
//! mismatched collectives. With either flag the ranks also agree on the
//! restore depth ([`agree_restore`]): the minimum depth any rank can restore,
//! taken only if every rank holds an exact-prefix snapshot at that depth, and
//! otherwise a full recompute everywhere. That costs one 4-byte
//! min-reduction per prefill, plus a second one when there is something to
//! restore (and a third when a branch checkpoint is a candidate). This is the
//! safety mechanism: the pools and eviction victims may diverge across ranks.
//!
//! # Rank env parity
//!
//! The flags are read per process. Both ranks MUST run with the same values
//! of `ATLAS_GLM_PC_EVICT`, `ATLAS_GLM_PC_BRANCH` and
//! `ATLAS_GLM_PC_BRANCH_MIN`; a rank with a different set issues different
//! collectives and chunk shapes and the pair deadlocks. This follows the
//! existing contract for `ATLAS_EP_PROTOCOL` (`ep_broadcast_seq_and_cmd`):
//! checking it in the binary would need a collective that also runs with the
//! flags off, so the launcher checks it instead.
//!
//! The launcher must check `ATLAS_GLM_PC_WRITE_FLOOR` and
//! `ATLAS_GLM_KV_WRITE_FLOOR_LEGACY` the same way. A mismatch there does not
//! deadlock (the cache writes they skip are not collectives), but one rank
//! then attends the cached rows of a shared block and the other its own
//! recompute of them, which is a silent TP numerics fault.
