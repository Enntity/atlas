//! KV lookahead for the batched verify (`ATLAS_QWEN4EXP_KV_LOOKAHEAD=<tokens>`,
//! default 0 = off; both ranks must agree, `startup_parity`).
//!
//! A decode or verify step votes on its KV admission whenever a sequence
//! crosses into a new block (`kv_admission.rs`): two rooted 4-byte NCCL
//! broadcasts with a host sync between, and the head waits there for the
//! worker to reach the same vote. At C8 x ~3.4 tokens a step that is ~1.7
//! votes a step, and in a real code wave (nsys, rank 0, 2026-10-07) the
//! head spent ~1 ms a step in those broadcasts: each pair is the 24 KV-poison
//! memsets of the new block, then `H2D:4, bcast, bcast(~0.5 ms), D2H:4`.
//!
//! With the switch, a batched verify that has to vote at all reserves every
//! sequence's blocks through `last position + lookahead` and votes ONCE for
//! the whole batch; the next ~lookahead / tokens-per-step steps need no new
//! block and no vote. Every input of the decision (sequence lengths, block
//! table lengths, row counts, the lookahead) is shared by the ranks, so they
//! vote at the same points. A refused lookahead vote (the pool cannot take
//! the extra blocks on some rank) falls back to the per-sequence votes of
//! exactly the step's needs, so the switch never refuses a step the default
//! admits. Block ids only place KV rows; every row is still written before it
//! is read, so tokens are unchanged.
