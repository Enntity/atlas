//! The fixed overhead of a prefix-cached ("warm") turn: what a request pays
//! before its first token that does not depend on its new tokens.
//!
//! # A warm turn, step by step
//!
//! `N` prompt tokens, of which the radix tree matches `matched` and an SSM
//! snapshot restores `restored <= matched`; chunks of `C` tokens
//! (`--max-prefill-tokens`), 16-token blocks. Both ranks run every model step
//! in lockstep; the worker follows the head's commands. Cost class in
//! brackets: `fixed` per request, `chunk` per prefill chunk, `pass` per chunk
//! that computes, `cached` per cached token or block, `new` per new row.
//!
//! 1. API thread: parse, render the template, tokenize the whole prompt
//!    [cached + new, host]. A client sees it; the scheduler's `TTFT=` (from
//!    the scheduler taking the request to its first token) does not.
//!    `ATLAS_CHAT_PHASE_TIMING=1` logs it (`template_render_and_tokenize`).
//!    Nothing here reduces it.
//! 2. Scheduler: allocate the sequence, send the request preamble (native
//!    fence, vision state) [fixed, a few 4-byte broadcasts].
//! 3. Per chunk, the head sends the chunk command: slot, command, chunk
//!    length, chunk start, prompt length [chunk, five 4-byte broadcasts, each
//!    a stream sync and a device read on the worker], then the whole prompt
//!    [chunk x cached: a pageable copy to the device, one broadcast, a sync
//!    and a read of `4 N` bytes on the worker].
//! 4. Per chunk, both ranks: zero the whole buffer arena [chunk, fixed
//!    size], embed the chunk [chunk x chunk rows]. A chunk below `restored`
//!    then computes nothing: it reserves its blocks (one min-vote, two 4-byte
//!    broadcasts), appends its tokens and returns.
//!    `ATLAS_GLM_WARM_SKIP_CACHED` does not zero or embed for such a chunk
//!    (`prefill_b::warm`; multi-rank worlds).
//! 5. Chunk 0 only: the radix walk and its references [cached blocks, host],
//!    the match min-vote [fixed], the restore-depth agreement with
//!    `ATLAS_GLM_PC_EVICT` or `_BRANCH` [fixed, one to three votes], the
//!    snapshot restore [fixed: one copy of the SSM state per rank].
//! 6. After every chunk, cached or not, both ranks normalize the sequence's
//!    SSM state [chunk: one launch per SSM layer], and the scheduler ends its
//!    tick. While another sequence decodes, the next chunk therefore waits
//!    for that sequence's decode or verify step [chunk x one step of the
//!    others]: five steps for the cached chunks of a 45K-token turn, over
//!    sixty at 512K. `ATLAS_GLM_WARM_CHUNK_RUN` (`spark-server`,
//!    `phase_continue_prefills`) runs the chunk after a cached one in the
//!    same tick.
//! 7. The chunk holding `restored` and every later one computes rows
//!    `[max(start, restored), end)`: the block-table upload [cached blocks on
//!    the first pass, new blocks after], positions and slots [new], a stream
//!    sync, then all layers [pass: fixed launches and collectives per layer;
//!    new: the weights each row's experts sweep, which dominates; new x
//!    context: attention and the index over the cached rows].
//! 8. The last chunk is split at the tail cut (`pc_policy::tail_cut`), so a
//!    warm turn runs two passes: `[restored, cut)`, then the checkpoint save
//!    at `cut` [fixed: one state copy, and the radix insert over the cached
//!    blocks], then `[cut, N)`. Each pass pays step 4 again. A turn whose
//!    restore depth is `cut` already has an empty first half, which
//!    `ATLAS_GLM_WARM_SKIP_CACHED` makes free. The cut sits 17 to 32 rows
//!    under `N`, and the next turn replays them [a fixed number of rows,
//!    each priced as `new`]; `ATLAS_GLM_TAIL_CUT_DEEP` (`pc_policy::tail_cut_at`)
//!    moves it one block up. That changes pass shapes, so it is its own
//!    switch.
//! 9. Final norm and LM head on the last row [fixed: one sweep of the head],
//!    the radix insert of the prompt [cached blocks, host], then the
//!    scheduler reads the logits and samples [fixed].
//!
//! `ATLAS_GLM_WARM_TRACE` logs one line per request and rank with the time
//! of steps 3 to 9 and a hash of the logits step 9 leaves ([`Trace`]). Its
//! `wall` minus its spans is the time between the request's chunks: command
//! words, the normalization and the wait of step 6. `ATLAS_PROFILE_PREFILL`
//! (per chunk, host submit time) and the scheduler's `Done: ... TTFT=` line
//! were there before; the per-request sum, the prompt transfer, the lookup,
//! the finish and any fingerprint of a warm prefill's result were not.
//! Steps 1 and 2 are outside the line (`CHAT_PHASE`, and `TTFT=` minus
//! `wall`).
//!
//! # What is not removed, and why
//!
//! * The arena zero of a chunk that computes, by default. The arena is
//!   shared scratch with layouts that do not follow the row count (the index
//!   logits of a row group over the whole context, the FlashKDA workspace,
//!   the MLA absorbed query), and `decode_a` documents a path that read rows
//!   it had not written. Zeroing "the rows this chunk uses" is therefore not
//!   the zero every pass starts from today. [`ZeroRows`] zeroes what earlier
//!   passes may have dirtied instead, behind `ATLAS_GLM_ZERO_ROWS`, with a
//!   check mode that measures whether that bound holds on a workload.
//! * The second pass of the tail split. One pass over `[restored, N)` runs
//!   the same math with other GEMM shapes, MoE groups and KDA pieces
//!   (`pc_policy`, "Accumulation order"), and the checkpoint at `cut` would
//!   need the KDA recurrence split in-pass, which only the `atlas_scale`
//!   build has (`midchunk_capture`).
//! * The full-chunk embed of a chunk that computes only its tail. Its rows
//!   past the computed ones are what a kernel reading beyond its rows sees
//!   today; skipping it would change them.
//! * The prompt in every chunk command (step 3). Sending only what the
//!   worker lacks changes the wire for what is derived as 0.3 ms a chunk at
//!   45K tokens and 2 ms at 512K; the trace's `transfer` span measures it.
//!
//! # Rank parity
//!
//! `ATLAS_GLM_TAIL_CUT_DEEP` sets the rows of every rank's passes: ranks
//! with different values run collectives of different sizes and the pair
//! hangs. `ATLAS_GLM_WARM_SKIP_CACHED` and `ATLAS_GLM_ZERO_ROWS` add no
//! command and no collective, and a request's own passes start from the same
//! arena either way; but a decode step of another sequence that runs between
//! two chunks finds what the last chunk left, so ranks with different values
//! hand that step different leftovers. All three must be the same on every
//! rank (`pc_policy::tail_cut_deep`, [`skip_cached_requested`], [`ZeroRows::from_env`]
//! are what a startup agreement reads). `ATLAS_GLM_WARM_TRACE` and the
//! scheduler's `ATLAS_GLM_WARM_CHUNK_RUN` are local to a rank.
