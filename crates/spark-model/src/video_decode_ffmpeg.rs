//! Frame extraction for real-world containers, via ffmpeg.
//!
//! # Why a subprocess and not a linked decoder
//!
//! The alternative evaluated was `openh264` plus a pure-Rust MP4 demuxer. It
//! builds quickly (~9 s on aarch64) and needs no runtime dependency, but it
//! covers **H.264 only** — no H.265, VP9 or AV1, which is a large share of
//! what people actually send — and Cisco's royalty-free patent grant covers
//! the binaries *Cisco* distributes, not a source build redistributed by a
//! third party. That is a licensing question for the project to answer
//! deliberately, not one to settle by adding a dependency.
//!
//! ffmpeg as a subprocess needs no build or link dependency, decodes
//! everything, and can be swapped for an in-process decoder later without
//! changing this module's signature. The cost is a runtime binary and a
//! process spawn per request, so it is OPT-IN and the absence of the binary
//! is reported by name rather than as a decode failure.
//!
//! # What is bounded
//!
//! Everything the caller controls, because the input is an untrusted byte
//! blob from an HTTP request:
//!
//! - **No shell.** Arguments are passed as argv. Nothing is interpolated into
//!   a command string, so no input can become a flag or a second command.
//! - **No temp file.** The container goes in over stdin, so there is no path
//!   to traverse, collide on, or leave behind.
//! - **`-nostdin`, and stdin is the pipe** — ffmpeg cannot reach for a
//!   terminal or block waiting on one.
//! - **Frame count** capped with `-frames:v`, so a long clip cannot decode
//!   forever — but the cap is applied to a plan that SPANS the clip
//!   ([`crate::video_sample`]) rather than to a fixed-rate walk that would
//!   stop `max_frames / fps` seconds in. See [`decode_frames`].
//! - **Duration probed first**, with ffprobe, because a plan that covers the
//!   whole clip has to know where the clip ends. A duration that cannot be
//!   determined is an ERROR, never a silent fallback to the first frames.
//! - **Decoded pixel memory** bounded by scaling each frame before it is read
//!   back: the PNG-size cap bounds what is READ from the pipe, not what the
//!   returned `Vec<RgbImage>` holds once it is parsed.
//! - **Output size** capped while reading, and the child is killed the moment
//!   the cap is passed.
//! - **Wall clock** capped by a watchdog that kills the child; a decoder that
//!   hangs must not hold a request thread indefinitely.
//! - **Protocol whitelist** is moot because the input is a pipe, but
//!   `-f image2pipe` output and a `pipe:0` input mean ffmpeg is never asked
//!   to open a URL — the SSRF path that `remote_image` guards for stills
//!   simply does not exist here.
