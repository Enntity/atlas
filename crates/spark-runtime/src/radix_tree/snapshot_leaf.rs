//! Finish leaves in the snapshot index (`ATLAS_GLM_PC_FINISH_LEAF`, which
//! needs `ATLAS_GLM_PC_EVICT`; nothing here runs with it off).
//!
//! A finish leaf is the state a turn had at the last block boundary its
//! decode crossed. It serves only the next turn of the same conversation, and
//! only when that turn's prompt reproduces the output up to the boundary, so
//! it must never cost a conversation a restore point it would otherwise have:
//!
//! * it is evicted before any chain frontier or branch point, and a leaf is
//!   given a slot only from the free list, dead history or another leaf
//!   ([`SsmSnapshotIndex::evict_for_leaf`]), never from a frontier;
//! * it is not linked into a chain and is no parent, so the prefill
//!   checkpoint under it stays its conversation's protected frontier until
//!   the next prefill checkpoint supersedes it. That checkpoint also makes
//!   the leaf dead history (`link_chain`): the turn it was saved for has run;
//! * a checkpoint already registered at its prefix wins.
//!
//! The turn a leaf was saved for settles it when it restores it
//! ([`SsmSnapshotIndex::settle_leaf`]). If that turn saves a checkpoint of
//! its own, the leaf is dead history from then on, so the turn's own slot
//! needs come out of its own leaf and not out of another conversation's. If
//! it saves none (its new message is shorter than the tail gap), the leaf is
//! promoted to an ordinary checkpoint and the conversation's frontier keeps
//! moving.
