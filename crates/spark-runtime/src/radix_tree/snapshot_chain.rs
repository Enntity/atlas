//! Chain-aware SSM snapshot retention (`ATLAS_GLM_PC_EVICT=1`, default off).
//!
//! # The problem with the default victim
//!
//! The default victim (`session_aware_victim`) groups entries by
//! `session_hash`, the hash of the first 1024 prompt tokens. Agentic clients
//! (omp, Claude-Code-like tools) open every session with the same system
//! prompt and tools, so every session lands in ONE group and the policy is
//! plain LRU over entries. Each turn saves one snapshot (its prompt tail), so
//! a session looping on fast tool calls fills all 16 slots with its own
//! history — every snapshot but its newest is useless to it — and evicts the
//! only restore point of each slower session, whose next turn then
//! re-prefills its whole 30-50K transcript.
//!
//! Also, on TP2 the worker rank never learns `session_hash` (it stays 0 on
//! every sequence the worker builds), so the two ranks can group differently
//! and pick different victims.
//!
//! # The policy
//!
//! Every snapshot joins a *chain*, one conversation's growing path, when it is
//! inserted. Its deepest ancestor, the deepest resident snapshot whose token
//! prefix is a prefix of the new one, decides which chain it joins:
//!
//! * no ancestor: the snapshot starts a new chain;
//! * the ancestor is its chain's deepest member: the new snapshot extends
//!   that chain, and the ancestor becomes *superseded*, because the next
//!   turn of that conversation restores from the deeper one;
//! * the chain already goes deeper along another path: two continuations
//!   diverge here, so the ancestor becomes a *branch* point and the new
//!   snapshot starts a new chain.
//!
//! Victims are then taken from superseded, non-branch entries first, least
//! recently used first. Chain frontiers and branch points go only after that,
//! also least recently used first. So a session owns one protected slot, not
//! sixteen, and an idle session loses its frontier only after every
//! conversation's dead history is gone and it is the stalest frontier left.
//!
//! `session_hash` is deliberately unused, so it no longer makes the ranks
//! choose differently. Victim identity is still NOT guaranteed identical
//! across ranks: a rank-local recency bump (the F83 re-lookup on a rank whose
//! match was capped, a lookup win the other rank does not have, or
//! [`SsmSnapshotIndex::resident_at`] on a rank restoring shallower than it
//! could) reorders that rank's LRU. The TP2 safety mechanism is the
//! restore-depth agreement in `spark-model` (`pc_policy`): every rank
//! restores at one agreed depth or all recompute, whatever each pool holds.
//!
//! With the flag on this victim replaces both the session-aware one and
//! `ATLAS_SNAP_EVICT_LEGACY`, and the tail lease is not consulted: tail
//! entries are never linked, so they rank as protected frontiers anyway.
//!
//! Finish leaves (`snapshot_leaf`) are a third class between the two: never
//! linked, evicted after dead history and before any frontier or branch, and
//! dead history themselves once a deeper checkpoint joins their path.
//!
//! Credit: the per-conversation retention and deepest-snapshot-wins ideas
//! follow Reederey87's prefix-cache policy (Apache-2.0, ideas only, no code),
//! and branch points follow Marconi (MLSys'25, arXiv:2411.19379).
