//! NVMe spill tier for the prefix cache (`ATLAS_KV_NVME_DIR`, default OFF).
//!
//! With the tier enabled, a cached block that LRU eviction would delete is
//! instead written to an NVMe record and its radix node stays in the tree as
//! "on disk". A later prefix hit reads those records back into freshly
//! allocated GPU blocks BEFORE the ordinary resident-only `lookup`, so every
//! existing consumer of [`super::PrefixMatch`] keeps seeing resident blocks
//! only. Tree bookkeeping (slots, disk LRU, budget) lives behind this trait;
//! the byte movement lives with the KV cache (`PagedKvCache::nvme_*`), so the
//! tree never performs I/O.
//!
//! Tree invariant (spill mode): a node on disk has only on-disk descendants.
//! Spill picks resident nodes with no RESIDENT children; restore promotes a
//! run top-down starting right below the resident prefix; `insert` re-homes an
//! on-disk node onto the inserting sequence's block top-down.

/// One eviction-time write the caller MUST perform before returning `block`
/// to the free list: copy the block's bytes to record `slot`, stamped `tag`.
