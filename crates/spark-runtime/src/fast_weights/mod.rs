//! Fast safetensors loader (InstantTensor-style) — pure Rust.
//!
//! Two wins over the mmap-based loader in [`crate::weights`]:
//!
//! 1. **`O_DIRECT`** reads. Bypasses the OS page cache, so the bytes never
//!    compete with GPU allocations on GB10 unified memory. The mmap path
//!    already works around this with `POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED` post-load; here
//!    we avoid the pollution in the first place.
//! 2. **Pipelined read/copy**. One background reader thread fetches the
//!    next tensor while the main thread does `copy_h2d` for the current
//!    one. Overlaps disk I/O with the host→device memcpy.
//!
//! Behavioural parity with [`crate::weights::SafetensorsLoader`] is
//! preserved — same EP filtering, same OOM pre-flight, same UVM fallback
//! on GPU allocation failure, same extra-weights handling.
