//! Fast path of the NVMe prefix tier (`ATLAS_GLM_NVME_FAST=1`): the same
//! records, tags and checksums as the synchronous path in `nvme_spill.rs`,
//! moved in three cheaper shapes (measured on a GB10; see
//! `docs/glm-nvme-prefix-cache.md` §9):
//!
//! 1. **Pitched copies.** A block's record is ~22 small device regions, and a
//!    small async copy costs several microseconds of copy-engine time whatever
//!    its size. Staging is laid out in BLOCK order, so a run of consecutive
//!    blocks is one pitched copy per region instead of one copy per region per
//!    block.
//! 2. **Run-sized I/O.** A run of consecutive slots is one request in either
//!    direction (`ConcurrentSwapStore`), not one `pwrite` per record.
//! 3. **Write-behind and read-ahead.** Checksums and disk I/O run on a small
//!    worker pool over a fixed ring of pinned staging chunks. A spill returns
//!    once the blocks' bytes are in staging — the blocks may be reused, their
//!    bytes are owned by the queued write — and a restore reads ahead while
//!    the serving thread scatters.
//!
//! Ordering rules the rest of the tier relies on:
//! * every queued write is on disk before any read is issued ([`FastIo::flush`]);
//! * no two queued writes touch the same slot — a spill that re-uses a slot
//!   still in flight drains the queue first — so the workers may write in any
//!   order and a re-issued slot still ends up holding its later record;
//! * a failed write is reported on the next [`write`] / `nvme_take_failed`,
//!   and until then its record fails verification (wrong tag), never restores.
