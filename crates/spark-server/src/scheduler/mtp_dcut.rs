//! D-Cut: adaptive verification-depth pruning (arXiv 2607.14647).
//!
//! # What it does
//!
//! The drafter emits `k_drafts` tokens per sequence and each one costs a VERIFY
//! ROW. Rows are the verify step's price: the batched forward reads every weight
//! once for `R = Σ rows_i` rows, and R is capped at 128 by the row buffers
//! (`VERIFY_ROW_BUDGET`; 64 before the wave-11 depth-at-width widening, 32
//! before the 32:1 ladder rung). D-Cut spends that budget where it will be
//! accepted instead of spreading it evenly — but only in the <= 8-sequence
//! regime it was measured to win ([`dcut_width_cap`]).
//!
//! The drafter reports a per-position top-1 log-probability `ln c_{i,t}`
//! (`argmax_bf16_batch_lp`). A draft at depth `j` is only reachable if every
//! draft before it was accepted, so its SURVIVAL score is the prefix product
//! `s_{i,j} = Π_{t<=j} c_{i,t}` — in log space the prefix SUM. All prunable
//! positions across the WHOLE batch are ranked by that score and the top
//! `ratio` fraction is retained.
//!
//! ★ Because log-probabilities are <= 0, `s_{i,j}` is non-increasing in `j`, so
//! the retained set is automatically a per-sequence contiguous PREFIX — no tree,
//! no gaps, just a per-sequence draft count. That is the whole reason this needs
//! ragged row counts and nothing else.
//!
//! # v1 scope (deliberate)
//!
//! * Every sequence keeps AT LEAST ONE of its drafts. That holds `rows_i` in
//!   2..=4 for a sequence that drafted — the envelope `can_batch_verify`, the
//!   `gdn_decode_wy{2,3,4}` handles and the SSM intermediates pools were built
//!   and audited for. D-Cut never prunes a sequence to zero drafts; a
//!   sequence that arrives WITHOUT drafts (a decode row riding the verify,
//!   `mtp_step/one_forward.rs`) is planned at one row and is not prunable.
//! * A sequence may hold fewer drafts than the ladder depth (the drafter's
//!   confidence stop). Its drafts cap its depth: positions it did not draft
//!   are not rankable, and no assignment may deepen it past them.
//! * The budget is a FIXED ratio from the discrete bucket set, not a profiled
//!   cost table. `ATLAS_MTP_DCUT_RATIO` picks it; values snap to the nearest
//!   bucket so the search space stays the paper's four points.
//! * Pruning changes only the VERIFY width. The propose already ran at full
//!   width when this is called, so v1 banks the row saving, not a drafter
//!   saving.
