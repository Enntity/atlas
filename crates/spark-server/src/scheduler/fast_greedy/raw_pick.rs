//! When a row's raw GPU argmax IS its pick, and the one-row pick built on it.
//!
//! Plain decode, the MTP bootstrap and the verify fast paths each skip the
//! host pipeline (D2H + dequant + masks + penalties + argmax) when it cannot
//! move the argmax. They used to decide that differently: decode sent
//! never-thinking rows to the GPU with penalties and bias ignored, but applied
//! them on the host whenever another row in the batch was thinking, and the
//! bootstrap took the raw argmax inside `<think>` with no pipeline at all. A
//! pick then depended on the batch's composition and on which path served it.
//! One rule now: the GPU argmax (lowest index on exact ties, as the host
//! argmax) is used only where the pipeline provably keeps it.
