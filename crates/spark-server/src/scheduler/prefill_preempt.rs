//! Prefill-chunk KV preemption, the chunk counterpart of
//! `preempt::decode_batch_with_preemption`.
//!
//! A chunk that cannot get its KV blocks is refused on every rank before its
//! forward pass, each rank's reservation rolled back
//! (`spark_model::model::kv_admission`). The head then kills a larger
//! in-flight sequence (its free is mirrored to the worker) and re-sends the
//! whole chunk command; the worker, which kept waiting, runs it again. Only
//! that agreed exhaustion refusal is retried. An agreed refusal for any other
//! reservation error fails just this request (every rank rolled back and the
//! worker kept waiting, so the normal release reaches it), and any other
//! error, including a "KV cache exhausted" raised once the forward has
//! begun, may have mutated state on some rank, so it fails this request as
//! before.
//!
//! The one progress a refused chunk can keep is a completed tail-checkpoint
//! split half (`prefill_b.rs`: tokens appended, recurrent state advanced to
//! the cut). `seq.seq_len` records it on both ranks, so every attempt starts
//! there ([`resume_point`]) instead of running that half twice.
