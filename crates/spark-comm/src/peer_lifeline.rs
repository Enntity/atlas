//! Peer-death lifeline for multi-rank serving.
//!
//! NCCL waits block in `cuStreamSynchronize` with no deadline, so a rank whose
//! peer process has died (crash, OOM kill, container stop) blocks in its next
//! collective forever while its HTTP readiness still says ready. The TCP
//! connections that carried the NCCL bootstrap ID are kept open for the
//! process lifetime instead: the kernel closes them when either process exits,
//! for any reason, so their end is a liveness signal independent of NCCL and
//! of the RDMA pair transport. TCP keepalive covers a peer host that stops
//! answering altogether and never sends a FIN.
//!
//! Nothing is written after the bootstrap ID, so a watcher's blocking read
//! returns only when the connection ends.
