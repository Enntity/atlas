//! TCP bootstrap of the RDMA pair (rank 0 listens). Both ranks address the
//! peer's region with their own layout, so each first sends a fixed-size
//! [`Head`] with everything the layout and the flag protocol depend on. Only
//! a peer whose head agrees is sent the identity: the region base, then per
//! rail the QPN, PSN, GID and region rkey, which together grant remote writes.
//!
//! The ranks get here seconds apart: the NCCL bootstrap and
//! `ncclCommInitRank` before it have already absorbed any difference in model
//! load time, and what remains is each rank pinning and registering its
//! region. The boot fails after `ATLAS_RDMA_PAIR_BOOT_TIMEOUT_S` (default
//! 120) rather than hang, and at once when the peer process has exited.
