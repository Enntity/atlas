//! In the PLE tower:
//!
//! * its RMSNorm is **grouped** (each of `hc_count` streams normalises over its
//!   own `hidden_size` slice) and its weight is an **offset from 1**
//!   (`x * (1 + w)`), not a plain scale;
//! * the gate takes a **signed square root** — `sign(g) * sqrt(max(|g|, 1e-6))`;
//! * the depthwise conv is **dilated by `ngram_size`**, so its state is
//!   `(kernel - 1) * ngram_size` wide rather than `kernel - 1`.
//!
//! In the hyper-connection block:
//!
//! * the mixing gate divides by `hc_count` BEFORE its activation, twice — once
//!   into the low-rank SiLU and again into the injection sigmoid;
//! * the block output is a **mean** across streams, not a sum or a concat, so
//!   it comes back `hidden` wide from a `hc_count * hidden` input;
//! * the injection weights are `2 * sigmoid(...)`, centred on 1 rather than
//!   0.5.
